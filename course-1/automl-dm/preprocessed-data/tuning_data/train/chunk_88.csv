1,I fell in love with the color and peplum design of this top online  and decided to order it. the fabric is soft  but strong  and the color is just as pictured. perfect for a casual shopping day or lunch date out with friends.
1,"I grabbed this on a lark because it look like a fun little ""throw on"" dress. it's a very lightweight sweatshirt material and fun and a fun flouncy design. run a bit large and regular sizing was still above my knees. if i were 30 years younger  i may have bought it just for lounging  but the over sized ruffly sleeves made me feel just a bit too silly and the color is pretty washed out. not for me  but cute for teens and early 20's."
-1,I wanted this tank to work so badly! it was a great deal and so beautiful. unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake. my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short. if you have a short torso  this would work great. if not  unfortunately  its not great - tear
-1,The fabric and its texture didn't meet my expectations unfortunately. there were too much fray and cast-off of edge yarns of a fabric...   however this will fit if you wear over the swimming wears.
-1,There were just too many pleats to this thing. it was not flattering. it looks fantastic on this model but not on me. oh well.
1,This dress was returned to my store and i was immediately drawn to it. i love absolutely anything with a full shape  and this dress has it! its cut like a circle...so ladies this dress has a lot of fabric. i'm 5'8 and wouldn't be able to wear it as a dress  but it made for an adorable tunic with leggings. the arms are a tad more fitted (though i have larger arms) which helped make the dress feel super cool and feminine. if you love a cool quirky piece  this one is a winner!
1,I have to agree with another poster who was dissapointed about the dress not being lined....i mean  any dress over $50 should at least be lined! but  overall this is an adorable dress  very flattering and so fun for summer! if it were lined i would have purchased  but that's all personal preference as i cannot stand having to wear a slip!
0,Great summer skirt  can be dressed up or down. the band top is weird  but you don't have to style it as pictured. i may get the top hemmed down the road.    i have a 32 waist and got a size large.
-1,I thought that this dress would be perfect for my 60th birthday  however i was disappointed when i received it. it is extremely heavy from the beading and i just did not find it pretty in person. it did nothing for me. also  it runs small and was tight.
0,"There is no back zip on this skirt and therefore it does not lay flat as it would if there were a zip. instead it has an elastic waist. it is very nice quality but i never would have purchased this skirt if i knew it had an elastic waist. i am 5'6"" and a size 6. it runs a bit large - i think this is due to the elastic waste."
1,This precious skirt is a treasure chest of soft bronze fabric circles scattered like coins at the bottom of a fountain. the circles are a bronze color and cannot be felt through the skirt net. it's finely finished and simply a nice piece for dinner out or a day in the office. i received many compliments on my first wearing.
-1,Is gigantic-it could be so cute  but the neckline and armholes are ridiculously low. i am 5 feet 10 and 140 pounds  and a small was huge on me.
-1,I have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color. these are less flattering and i may not keep them.
-1,I was very disappointed by the fit of this top. it is quite short (especially in the back) and very wide. i did not find it flattering. on a positive note  the fabric is nice and thick - very warm layering piece for fall. for sizing reference  i'm 5'5''  122 lbs  and took my usual size xs.
-1,When i read car coat  i expect a little more weight. it really is just a thin  long blazer. also  the colors appear different online. i expected a red/maroon with bue and white stripe  so maybe i mis-read completely...? it is actually brown/mustard/beige combo. not what i expected  so it will be a return.
1,I feel really cool wearing this skirt :-) a nice alternative to the jeans that are my standard uniform. loooks great with short boots. i'm wearing it as i write this review--and was wearing it all day. awesome skirt!
0,I ordered the pink in size xl. the color was pretty. the problem is the material was too thin and tight. it ran at least a size smaller than shown in the photos online.
1,Great with leggings and skinny jeans! it's comfortable too!
-1,I snapped this up under the 20% off top sale and free shipping because it looks so pretty. i ordered a large because i usually take a large or xl in tops. it is huge! i could have taken a medium if not for the lining -- which is tiny! the lining does not cover the chest and bra area and hits the belly button area while the orange part falls down to the hips. and it looks like a block and makes me look wide. who needs that? like i said  a medium would fit better and would not be so wide  but i fe
0,"I so wanted to love this dress. i bought it in a size 4 and in both petite and regular  as i'm kind of in between and have a long torso and short legs. anyway  i'm 5'5"" tall and 130 lbs. the regular fit my torso well  and length not was too bad. with heals it might have worked without hemming. here is where it all fell apart. while understand that only really expensive designer clothing can afford to seam a pattern perfectly  i felt that the dot seam in the front of the dress was in a bad place."
-1,Contrary to the first review  there is a zipper so while it wasn't easy to get on  it did fit over my bust. i found this too small and high waisted  and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso. what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo. it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering. the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l
1,Love the pattern on this lightweight cardigan and it is super flattering. i tried ordering the xs/s first because the next size up just sounded too big  but i ultimately had to order up for more room in shoulders and length in arms  though. i'm hoping the m/l fits without too much spare fabric because it really is a great piece.
1,I'm glad i checked out the reviews before purchasing - i went a size smaller and the sweater fit perfectly! i love the taupe color - it's feminine (not overtly so) and i can still use it as a neutral. the quality is really quite good  though i would still suggest keeping metal accessories (without smooth edges) away from the fabric. it's also not too heavy so i can still wear this despite the heat and humidity in honolulu.     i think the only thing i would consider changing would be the materia
0,"I ordered the dress online and found it to be not as pictured.  the length hit several inches above the knee.  the sleeves are also 3/4 length rather than full length as pictured.  i found the cut to be much less fitted through the torso as well.  i tried both the small and xsmall  which are my usual sizes.  the small was very loose through the torso  the xsmall was better  but looked overall too short  as if it were a petite cut.  i am 5'9""  however the model is supposed to be 5'10""."
0,This dress has gorgeous fabric and impeccable quality construction! i'm 5'4 118lbs and large busted (32. dd). i am usually an overall size 4 but when buying dresses usually have to purchase a six to accommodate my chest. i ordered a size 4 because that was the only size left and was going to take a chance . it fit perfect across the chest but the overall dress is enormous! does not even slightly silhouette your figure. it is like a giant stiff triangle. i was going to return but was so hesitant
1,This is my new favorite top! looks and fits as described.
1,"I love sweater knit dresses and this the first one i've owned with a flare style that works. pattern placement is gorgeously done and is very slimming in a non-obvious way. i think the fabric is soft and warm. i wish the scoop neckline was a tad bit higher from a modesty standpoint. you may want to size down if you're not busty. i am 5'3"" and m petite was the perfect length on me. shout out to the reno distribution center for getting this amazing dress to me in 1.5 days?!?!?!!!"
-1,The material is cheap and looks torn. not as nice as the picture.
0,I am normally a size 8 in dresses and bought this in a small. so if you are a smaller person  this would likely be a bit loose on you. the color was odd. i liked the navy blue  but the pink was a pepto bismol colored pink. i just felt like i would get sick of the color/pattern after one wear. the fit is cute and comfy.
-1,I ordered an xxs online and it's still massive. the only thing i can use it for is a beach coverup. the embroidery is pretty but i will be returning.
0,The shirt is great except for the arms!! the band around the arms are tight and it makes the arm holes gape weirdly unless you are standing with your arms straight down by your side.
0,This lift weight cardigan is true to size  perfect for fall or spring. colors are quite nice  especially the little pops of orange.
-1,I am returning the dress. it has too much volume and is not flattering at all
1,So wanted to love this top. love the look entirely. but the medium was beyond snug  so i sent it back for a large. hopefully the bigger size will make it a keeper!
0,This dress felt small in torso and waist and suffocating in sleeves ( i do have average athletic arms). but the shoulders were cut so wide that one side was falling off  as i fix  one shoulder  another will slide down. the material is nice but since it is not lined  it feels inexpensive  disposable.
0,"I ordered this online and was disappointed with the fit when it arrived. i ordered the xs and it was still oversize to the point of being unflattering. i am tall 5'9"" about 130 pounds and have a fairly thin torso and look best in cloths that have some shape. if you like a loose fit this might be for you. the material is thicker and warm and comfortable. i would suggest ordering down a size."
0,The fabric is so soft  but it was too roomy in the top and miid-section so it didn't flatter my body.
1,This sweater is gorgeous - the colors are beautiful and the piece itself is soft. i do think it is a bit shorter than i would prefer  and i tend to wear petites. the sweater is nice enough that i do not mind!
0,I like the look of this sweater and i am keeping it. however  i found the fit under the arms a little uncomfortable. there is a large seem that goes under the armpit and is a little bulky and irritating. also would not recommend if you are busty. because of how the stripes run  it looks stretched out over my chest.
1,"This dress makes me looks curvy thin and sexy! i tried on almost every dress in the store in every style. this one was a winner. i bought 2 others but this one was my favorite. i'm 5'5"" 130 (32dd) sz4 fit perfect. the picture on-line does not do it justice - you must give it a chance and try it on for yourself. it looks like an average dress on the model - if you have curves you'll love this dress!"
-1,I really liked the style and fit of this shirt but i'm giving it a 2 because i shirt should last longer than 6 months. i've taken it to the cleaners 2 times and the fabric behind the tag beneath the collar has fallen apart and there are holes.
-1,"Alas  i so wanted to love this. the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous -- flowy  drapey  ultimate grecian goddess. but it just doesn't work unless you're super-skinny. too much material. almost bulky; strange looking. the print is so beautiful -- i love the pink floral  and i love the whole idea of the dress. but it just doesn't work. have to send it back.     (i'm 5'6""  135 pounds  38-30-38  and i ordered a 10.)"
1,I adore this blouse. the colors are vibrant (see my photo below). this is one of my favorite purchases from retailer. the top is light weight. true to size. i ordered a petite small and am 5 feet tall 120 lbs. and curvy. i left it untucked and loose like in the photo and it was very flattering. i disagree about it being frumpy. i wore it with kelly green retailer brand slacks paired with the retailer yellow sweater coat with white piping  and the retailer moss suede cross bag and neutral color (nude) fl
-1,I usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops  ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent.  not even remotely flattering.  i thought about ordering it in an xs  however  i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric.  back it goes.
1,"I bought this as a gift for a friend that is getting married in a few months. it's so soft and cozy  i'm tempted to keep it! i got the xs/s regular in white and was worried it would be too long but hits my natural waist (belly button) and i've got a shorter torso and am 5'4.5"". i got this during the 40% sweater sale and feel it is worth the full price. a fun piece but not one to keep you warm on a cold night  more of a cab to curb piece."
1,I read the reviews prior to purchasing but loved the pattern so much i had to have it. i was not disappointed however  had i not read the reviews i would have been. it is true the top of the dress is flat and does not have the detail as shown on the model. it also appears to be disproportionate. i am 5'1 and curvy the bottom fits well but the top is large however rectified by wearing a padded bra. since i ordered the petite i was surprised the dress was above the ankle (usually their items are l
1,Beautiful top... the print is really unique and already received compliments on it when running my daughter in for school. it's a little fuller on the bottom and flows out so i think i may pin it but it's beautiful. definitely worth getting!
0,While this top has a lovely design  neckline and color the metalic threads made it too shimmery for me. i actually think it looks better in pictures than in person because of the metallic threads.
1,Super cute and simple shirt (as other reviewer said lol). but she was right! i have another shirt from this brand and it's one of my favorites. it runs true to size. it's a nice casual wear with jeans kind of shirt and great for fall. it may be a little short for someone with a long torso and/or tall as i'm only 5'2 and i wouldn't want it to be any shorter.
-1,Don't buy this dress unless you are normally a medium or larger. order it one or two sizes smaller than your normal size. i ordered an xs and it's more like a medium or large.
-1,Really wanted to love...but...the way it fit..lower part a tad too flowy...almost maternity like to hide a belly and the top area feels like my chest is being smushed! despite my bra size being a modest 36b...the look it gave was square on top almost block like with bottom that had flare...such a pretty top unfortunately the overall design just didn't work me.
-1,I am petite and ordered size small  and it came looking like gym sweat pants. the material was very nice  but in terms of the waist and length size  both run incredibly large. the cuff of the joggers are also not elastic at all  and hangs loose widely. will have to return this item  unfortunately.
0,I didn't plan to wear this off shoulder. sadly the neck is too loose and big if worn on shoulder. the fabric is nice. i liked the vintage looking design that's black with purple flowers. the body has a lot of fabric and although i ordered size large  i would size down to a medium if i were to reorder. don't think i will  though.
-1,This one will be going back. the color is really blah and the fabric wasn't a texture i was expecting--it is kind of thick and ribbed and i suspect it would stretch out over the course of the day. overall  the cut and style is cute  but i just felt like i was wearing a hospital gown with the combination of the fabric and the style. this may have been cute in a more vibrant color and lighter weight fabric.
-1,Usually i really like deletta and know the sizing and shapes. this top looked pretty in the pics and i thought it would be a nice change from a tee. it was baggy  hung low and the layers just looked boxy and shapeless.
1,This coat is just as nice as the russian one from a few years ago  and fits the same. it is stunning! i swear  life is way too short to wear only average coats. if you are a parks and recreation fan  think back to the treat yo self episode.....and you'll know what i mean! i can't say enough wonderful things about this one.
-1,I agree with the other reviewer about the great colors  but when i took this off the rack to try one  you can see through both layers of fabric. i thought  insulting quality  for the price. i imagine the holes would start after one wearing.
-1,Shorts don't fit me like they did the first time and i've only worn them twice! the material isn't what is use to be. it stretches out to fast. i don't think i will be buying these again. wish i could take them back.
0,I wanted to love this dress but the sizing was too large for me  overwhelming my frame. i am very petite; for reference  5'2  24 waist  30  and usually get an xxsp or 00p but even the 00p was too large in both the waist and especially in the shoulder area. at minimum for fit  i would have had to have the dress taken up but required too much alteration. the skirt is not lined which i found disappointing  given the price. the colors and handkerchief like hem is really cute though but i returned.
0,Tried this on in store and it runs very small. i am a size 4  but have curvy hips  so i sized up to a size 6 and i couldn't even button it. i was hoping it was more of an a-line  but it's fit more like a pencil skirt. not very flattering on my body type. overall  cute design  but not for me.
0,I really loved how this top looked and was really excited it to get it on sale. i was worried that it might be too small/tight (i ordered a m and would consider myself a m) but was relieved to find it fit just fine. i was extremely disappointed to find that it was too sheer to wear by itself and still showed my bra with a layering tank on underneath. it was also more like a crop top for length  which does not work with my mama belly.
-1,I loved this dress online and was luckily able to locate it in a store about an hour away from me. i drove to the store to purchase it; however  when i tried it on  i was so disappointed! the print is adorable and it is made of great quality  but the swing style is definitely more than mini! i could have fit 3 of myself in this dress. it is definitely not as depicted in the photographs. also  the background of the dress is way more pink than appears in the photos  and the floral print isn't as r
0,"This top is a tough one. i ordered my usual medium. i'm 5'7""  165 lbs  34c  and wear a 10/m pretty much all the time (tops and bottoms). let's begin:  the bad: when i tried it on  i found the bust to be too small  and the darting on the sides puckered in a very non-flattering way. the ruffle at the neck stood up more like a mock turtleneck (which is not my scene). also  the fabric seemed a little thin for chambray.  the good: the pattern is adorable. the sleeveless design would be great under bl"
0,I found the fit of this dress to be true to size with a flattering bust and waistline; however  the fabric feels cheap and doesn't drape as nicely as i'd hope for the price. this would be a lovely dress in a better quality fabric. for sizing reference  i'm 5'5''  122 lbs  30dd  and took my usual size xs - though i'm busty for my size  the top provides nice coverage.
0,Great style but not so great quality:(  stone fell off right away.  but they still look great
0,I like this top. in the photo  the white in the print stands out. in-person  the white areas of the print (not embroidery) is dull  more like beige. the flowers and embroidery itself looks good  the print looks good. it is a swing top  looks better on a slender frame. such loose fitting tops just don't look good on my curvy frame. i sized down  could have tried 2 sizes down but the shoulder area was more fitted. i recommend the top for a more slender frame or if you like very loose fitting tops.
1,I purchased the grey jacket first and it seems to work with a lot of things and create different looks. so i purchased the tan jacket. i found it to less tan as an olive color. not my favorite color for me. but the fit is awesome and hopefully the color will prove to be versatile too. the blouse shown with it does not go with it as i had hoped. the jacket seems very green with the golden brown in the blouse. so a black or ivory blouse with some great necklace should work. recommend. pretty true
1,Love this skirt! it's definitely on the tight side  but is a stretchy material. i'm between a 6 and an 8 and went with the six because i liked the way it hugged my curves. as an hourglass shape i sometimes have problems finding pencil skirts - they either fit in the hips and are big at the waitband or the other way around. this one fit great throughout  and was both slimming in the front and flattering in the back. i was also worried that if i tucked anything into this skirt there would be weird
0,Love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back. also  it is a flowly top so you will need to size down. however  because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms. this didn't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type (as in not the model type). i am not overweight but it definitely didn't flatter my chest area. seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first.
1,"Color  fabric blend  and pattern are even more beautiful in person! unfortunately  i wont be keeping this due to length. i am only 5'3"" and this top dropped only to about 2 inches below my navel. if you have a short torso  or like the short look  i would recommend this!"
0,This blazer is a nice weight for summer. it is more terracotta than rose  but is still a nice color. the fit is tts and flattering. however  the buttons were almost falling off the one i received. i didn't take this as a sign of great quality and plan to return it.
