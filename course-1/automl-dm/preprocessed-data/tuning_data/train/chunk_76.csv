0,The concept of this top is edgy for a sweatshirt fabric. i think it works better on a thin frame instead of my curvy frame. although i appreciate the design  it did not work for me.
-1,This is cut very strangely  i'm short waisted and this barely covered my belly button. the material is rough and scratchy. did not like at all and will be returning.
-1,I brought this shirt for a vacation  it fitted well and was flattering. totally a comfortable wear  however  after 1 wash on delicate & hang dry small holes appeared near the bottom. i am hoping i can return it. not worth the money.
-1,"After reading every review  i was certain i knew exactly what i was getting with this dress. wrong. i sized up from a small to a medium and the dress was still uncomfortably tight on my rib cage. the top is very exposing of the bust  and i'm small busted. i can't stand wearing camis  so there no way i'd be able to wear this dress even if i sized up again to a large. for reference  i'm 5'6""  a straight build 134 lbs  and wear a 6. pluses on this dress are  i loved the green color and length of sk"
-1,I've been eyeing this dress for months  so when it went on sale i finally purchased it. now i see why it's on sale. the dress runs extremely large and has no shape.... looks like a potatoe sack and i feel like moo...moo in it! this will be going back to the store!!!!
-1,I purchased this sweater in a small . nothing on the web site states it has dolman sleeves! it looked sloppy and made my bust disappear! it went back i hate dolman sleeves.
1,I ordered the white in this. i found it to be so much prettier in person than the photos. i don't think they do this piece justice. i am normally a medium and that is what i ordered. i found it fit true to size. love the three ties in the back. it's a tad baggy  but looks great. i can see that this might snag easily though.
-1,Like other reviewers have said  this item runs extremely long and large. i could have fit my body in one pant leg they were so wide--much wider than any standard wide leg pant i've owned. sadly had to return.
0,"This is one of those dresses that is just ""nice"" and can be one that you go to in a pinch.... it flows very nicely and you can dress it up and down. it's not the best quality in fabric...but if it was all silk you would have paid 3xs. i like it  it fits well...it's not outstanding or unusual. i think it is a bit pricey for what you get...but  it's a ""work horse"" dress...it will do you right whenever you need it to!"
-1,I saw this dress and immediately started daydreaming about wearing it while honeymooning in italy along the amalfi coast or the cinque terre with my husband. and then i tried this dress on and immediately woke up. the cut is a disaster  the quality is terrible  and the dress just plain didn't work. the strips of elastic were sewn unevenly  giving the appearance that there was one large breast and one non-existent breast. the neckline was so long that it had to have the elastic run over the outsi
-1,I've been looking for a nice summer maxi dress and after reading some positive reviews  i decided to get the dress. the fabric is soft and has a nice flow to it. however  i had to return the dress because the cuff of the sleeve was too tight on my forearm  which make it impossible for me to raise my arms.    i ordered size petite xxs
-1,"Sadly  this has to go back. i am 5'5""  128 lbs and this shirt is super short on me. very short. and it's so wide it's almost a trapeze cut. the overall effect is 50s/60s style maternity shirt. which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful  the detail is nice in person  even the sleeve cuffs are great. i am not very tall and i'm fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles  loose and tight. the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering."
1,This dress is lovely. i'm tempted to buy it in all of the patterns that i like  but i'm forcing myself to be economical. (i check regularly to see if it's on sale  however! then they're all mine!)  this dress is soft  comfortable  classy  and has the unique feature of having a low-cut back. my only complaint is that the holes for the arms droop sometimes so reveal my bra. this could be from my shape  however  because i am rather busty. the dress runs true to size and is easy to clean. it's one o
1,I saw this on a mannequin at the store and was instantly drawn in by all the beautiful blue lace and the overall design. however  when i tried it on  i personally found a few things that just didn't work for me:  ____________  pros:  - blue lace is lovely throughout  nicely done.  - there's a little snap closure at the front of the dress where the fabric overlaps at the bra cups. i can only assume it's to make it easier to get the dress on. it's a nice little detail  although not sure if really
-1,I love these pants. bought them in both black and burgundy. but the burgundy pair split in the butt before i even made it to work in the morning. they weren't even tight. so disappointing. i will be returning them.
-1,I was leery of purchasing this blazer online without any reviews to read...and now i know better. the color and fabric are nice and what you would expect from the photos. the sleeves  however  ran small compared to the body. the shoulders also pulled and felt narrow compared to the torso. the body the opposite...too large and not flattering on an hourglass figure...no darts  no fitted places  nothing making it tailored to fit. open it hung wide with an unflattering silhouette. buttoned  it sprea
0,I loved the lavender color on the cape. it was soft and comfortable. but the design on the front ruined it for me. it took me all of 1 minute to know it was going back. it looked like florescent bird feathers nothing wrong with that  it just wasn't my style at all. i was a bit disappointed as it would have been perfect for cool ca nights. it looked more subdued in the photo  it's not. i clicked i would recommend to others as it is nicely made and i guess just not my taste as far as the colors an
1,I loved this top so much i bought it in both colors. i have not seen anyone complain about this  but on me  the mock neck collapses in and looks messy. unfortunately i returned both. i sew  and i do not understand why this happened.
1,I saw this initially in the store and thought it was nice but did not purchase because i thought the price was too high.  i saw it again and it was on sale but the store had sold out of my size.  i checked online and my size was available so i ordered.  i was afraid this cape would be to long and make me look frumpy but it wasn't and i didn't.  it looked great. i tie the belt a little higher than the model to make me look taller.   i can't wait to wear it on cool fall days.
0,I ordered this after seeing the rave reviews. it is not for me. just like the culottes i ordered  this romper makes me feel like a grandma. i said i'd recommend to others bc of the other reviews but again  this was not for me. i also didn't like the back of the romper. no way i could even get away with a racerback bra b/c it's so low cut. the good though- it is super comfortable and is a nice heavy fabric. tts also. i'm a med 8/10 and the medium was correct in this.
-1,Love the color and overall design of this dress...but it's just going to have to go back. the view from the direct front and back are nice  but froth side the high waist and secure back make me look pregnant. not the look i'm going for especially at this price.    the other oddity is that the white circle design is unfortunately placed! in the back it's all i see which is 'right' on a bulls-eye and the same on the front. i don't know how the designer missed this! it's the only white design on th
1,This arrived today and i am thrilled with it. the material is soft but not at all clingy. it drapes perfectly  falling just above the knee. there is a matching slip that is as nicely made as the dress itself. what a find!
-1,This is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area. it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area. the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves. it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what. but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it.
1,This tee is so soft and comfy. it looks nicer than a regular tee but still casual. fits true to size  and not too loose  but not too clingy. i know i'll wear this one a lot!
1,The shirt is a little roomy but so flattering. the design with little see through holes across the shirt are unusual and make it unique.
0,I really like the look of this dress  but i ended up returning it because it was too short. the shoulder area was also too big on me.
-1,Length too long and waist to high. these are not sized for petites.
0,I so wanted to love this but was underwhelmed - ii am tall but yet it hit below my knee in that awkward spot that is just a tad too long to be hip stylish and too short to be evening cocktail - just felt / looked frumpy ... i do think it looks great on other reviewers though so may just be that if wasn't a good fit for my body type - i wore my normal size 6 and it just didn't flatter - made me feel 10 years older
0,I usually wear petite which this was not so a little big for me. but nice color and good quality  but pricey for what it is. it's more like a $45 sweater not $100+
1,"This is so pretty! it was beautiful in white but i bought the blue because the fabric is a little bit see through. i'm 5' 4"" and weigh about 135 and this shirt fit just like on the model in the picture. it was a nice neat loose. not sloppy at all."
0,I absolutely loved these pants the first several times i wore them. the fit is flattering  they are a perfect long length  and the colors are stunning. after several wears  it was time to wash them and i followed the directions provided to wash with cold water and line dry. i was initially horrified with the amount that these pants shrunk in fit and length and the colors ran together. after a lengthy ironing session  i was able to smooth out the material and restore much of the length and fit bu
1,This tee is versatile  soft  well made  and it washes/dries well. i love longer length and stripe pocket details. it runs true to size  and it is a beautiful dark navy blue. what more can i ask for?
0,About a month ago i purchased the pilcro hypen chinos in moss size 28 petite. i loved the color and fit so much that when i saw free shipping being offered i decided to get another pair. this time i ordered the color ?pink? and of course size 28 petite. well the color really isn?t pink and unlike the moss color it does not look the color online. the color is more like salmon or apricot definitely not pink. what bothered me more is the fit. this pair was too big. it?s mind-boggling why the sizing
1,So super soft and comfortable - great to throw on to run errands with ease while still looking stylish - the lace up front makes it more special that just a standard tee shirt dress
0,I love the design and aesthetic of this dress but when i tried it on it was less than flattering on me and looked almost night gown ish:(  really sad because the material is gorgeous! i bought it for my sister instead because i know it will flatter her body type more than mine.  i'm rather full on bottom and top and it seems to look better on slender women.  the only complaint  is have is that the straps seem delicate. the actual material and fabric is crazy beautiful though!
-1,I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs  i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam  they are actually 28 in... not 24 in as in the description. other than the inseam issues  they fit like typical paige denim.
0,When i first saw this shirt online i was so excited! it reminded me of why i love shopping in the fall! unfortunately when it came i was so disappointed. in person the fabric and the colors are gorgeous. it's fairly lightweight for a flannel but so soft and comfy cozy. i love the navy/cream polka dot that is on the inside of the cuffs and collar as well  and the buttons are cute too! when i put it on it was so comfortable  but it made me look like i was pregnant! especially from the side it just
1,This top is perfect! very comfortable and flattering for any body type.
1,Loving this jumpsuit! i normally a medium top small bottom i bought the medium it fits right. soft fabric and nice color.
0,"I didn't know what to put for ""runs small  true to size  or runs large "" but it required me to put something...i first ordered the xl  and it was ridiculously gianormous. the next time  i ordered a large. i thought the large would either be a perfect fit or still too large  based on how the xl had fit. the large was too tight! i could not believe it! it is too bad  for i love the design and color of this top! i ordered it in the muted red color. if you can find a size that works for you  go for"
-1,I love this top (so cute and comfy!)  but i wore it twice  washed it once on gentle and layed to dry.....now there are 2 small holes in the front. for as much as it cost  i would have expected it to be more durable. very disappointing  especially since i don't live near an retailer and can't take it back easily......
0,"I'm 5'9"" and 155lb. i have been wearing small a but this was realllllly small especially at my arms. it made me look like i was taking off... much more beautiful on the model. a medium would e been too big on my torso. the color is amazing! made my blonde hair really pop. i don't love green but this was so different.  would love to find something else in this color that suits me! you need to be a super skinny waif to look good in this!"
1,Fun versatile top for casual wear with capris  denim  or shorts/skirts. purchased both striped versions. love ballet necklines. the 3/4 length sleeve is wonderful for spring  summer  fall in california. the top is fitted yet it runs small. be sure to sized up. i normally wear xs  however this was way too tight. so i've ordered a small in both. hoping it works perfectly.
-1,I really wanted to like these  but they just didn't look right on my 5'3 sorta bulky frame. i have big thighs and always feel out of place wearing leggings  so maybe i'm just not the right target for these  but they looked so cute and i wanted to give them a try. the waist was too high for my liking  and the leg openings were too big and gave me a stumpified look.
0,Hangs terribly off the chest. tent-like. looks maternity. no thanks.
0,I bought these pants in white and tan. they are comfortable and fit great.however  they tend to stretch. i just got them and they are already starting to become uncomfortably loose. i still really like them but i recommend you buy a little tight so they become comfortable.
1,Following another reviewer's advice  i ordered up to an xl. it's huge. stick with your normal size or go down one. it's a one of a kind piece. soft  lightweight  yet cozy and adorable. sadly have to return mine.
-1,Man  this dress is the worst. i don't understand how it looks the way it does on the model. agree with previous reviewer - there must be a minimum of 200 pins pulling the waves and waves of extra fabric back. this dress looks so cute   but is so  so  so disappointing in person. sweater collar and cuffs - stiff and bulky. dress - billowy and sack-like - not sure how they got a belt to pull it all in. save yourself the return and do not get sucked in by the sale price and extra sale discount like
0,"I tried this dress at the store and it made me look 10 years older. the fit was tts but a bit odd around the waist. i am 5'4"" and 160 lbs and tried a small."
0,This romper was not what i expected when i originally purchased. it is much more casual looking in person  and as soon as i got it out of the bag  one of the buttons fell off. it did look good on and fit well  but i will be returning because it is too casual for the occasion i bought it for.
0,"I ordered 2 sizes to try for in store pickup. both were too large  so size down (i am 5'4""  125 lbs and the s was too large in the neck and body  even though i generally wear things large). also  the collar was a hemmed flat collar  not the roll collar depicted. i reviewed that with the salesperson as well -- we were both at a loss to explain why  and the tiger embellishments were more orange  yellow and glittery on the ones i ordered."
1,I love this jacket so much  i bought two. it goes with almost everything and is a nice weight for almost any weather. i recommend you grab it while it's on sale.
1,Beautiful choice...beautiful fit for my daughter's slim body
-1,"Saw this on line and decided to ""splurge"" for the holidays. arrived today and is going right back. runs very small especially in the waist. trim is a cheap ribbed fabric with a zipper. fabric is not elegant looking as in the picture  appears cheap and very itchy. sooooo disappointed."
1,This dress is perfect. it's ridiculously soft (i felt like i was wearing pajamas) and it fits perfectly. the quality is great; well worth your purchase.
0,Loved the look  quality was great  but didn't work for me. too busy and off-fitting. i did return.
1,This romper checks off all the boxes! it's beautiful and the fit is perfect!
-1,I ordered this dress  expecting a cool lightweight summer dress. i believe it says cotton in the description.however the material is a very heavy cotton-linen blend.would have much preferred a better quality fabric.the color is a nice green and is well made.it runs large  except in the bust which fit well.
1,I'm petite and pear shaped so i'm small on top and curvy around the hips and love the way this dress fits. it's a relaxed fit so it's not super fitted and it's loose around the waist which is great. it's a wonderful casual dress to wear with a pair of tall boots. i adore it!
-1,I was so excited for this dress to come. i am 5&#39;1&quot; and 100lbs so i ordered and xs petite. it was literally falling down around my shoulders and gigantic all around. maybe on someone taller this would have looked great. i was also disappointed that the blue shown online was not accurate. my dress was a much lighter blue. back to the store it goes.
1,This is such a unique design and i love the colors. i could be a small or x-small and chose the x-small  fits perfectly.
0,Beautiful color; however  the fabric did not work for me. tight on top  large on bottom.
0,"I expected to love this  since i usually look good in this style of jacket. it's definitely comfortable and the fit was fine  but i really don't care for the wooden buttons and the overall look was just ""meh."" it's going back  unfortunately."
0,I thought this dress was very cute on the model  however it was way too tight across the chest for me. going up a size would mean it would be too roomy everywhere else. also  fabric wasn't great.
1,I had been admiring this dress for over a year and finally treated myself to it for the holidays. first  it is gorgeous and very thoughtfully designed to make you look amazing. where things fall off the rails for me is the fabric choice for the sleeves...they are sooo delicate and evidently snag far too easily. the dress that i received in the mail had two large snags (one in each sleeve) that were already running a bit. to me that was a huge red flag that i shouldn't be spending so much money o
-1,I don't have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine. i also ordered the xs even though i'm usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked. already returned it. on the plus side  it's gorgeous.
-1,I saw the photo of the young woman wearing this dress in the reviews and she looked beautiful  i on the other hand looked awful. the fabric of the entire dress is quite stiff  so the dress didn't move with me; it sort of felt as if i was wearing a paper cut out. then to contribute to the volume  the sleeve is not set in  it is a raglan style  that on me looked more like a bat suit  than what i was hoping for  a beautiful distinctive dress for an important affair. also the belt didn't enhance the
0,"I think the model is wearing a larger size  per the first review. i am 5'2"" and 105 lbs and the xs fits about the same in length but not nearly voluminous. so you should order up if that is what you want. this will be perfect for some long summer flights instead of a wrap  since the sleeves will be more convenient and i always look schlumpy rather than elegant in a shawl! if it had some cashmere or another softer fiber i would be totally in love with it."
1,Love this shirt. tried it on in 2 of the colors and both were very flattering. the quality of the shirt is great. worth the price for sure!
1,"I bought this dress for my upcoming rehearsal dinner in early fall. i love the romantic lace and ivory color for the occasion. i ordered my typical size 10. it hits me right where it does on the model and it fits well on top  but the dress ""bells"" more than the images let on. i didn't want to size down in fear that the neck would be too tight  so i took it to an alterations specialist to get a lot of the lace fabric trimmed off. she took it in a little at the waste and the underarm  and hacked q"
-1,"When i unwrapped this a chemical ""stink"" hit me that amost knocked me over. it was really unbearable and i m not overly sensitive to smells. second it was way too large with a boxy unflattering cut. the waist sits very high at elbow height and every below the waist the material balloons out in a rediculous manner. i wonder if they had it pinned down somehow on the picture here. with a more flattering cut i might have decided to wash it a few times to get the stink out. i do not recommend this fo"
