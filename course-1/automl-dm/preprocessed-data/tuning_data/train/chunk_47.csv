1,Got these in my usual size and they are wonderful! the gray goes with everything  i'm hoping they come out with some greens or blues too!
1,"Just tried 'layered sadie top' and it felt so nice on. good hand feel for both materials but note that the knit on top is a little too delicate for machine wash but can be hand washed. this item is definitely ""vanity-sized"". i'm 5'1  113lbs and the xs looked nothing like how it does on the model. it was flowy as depicted but it came down much lower on me and looked a little maternity-esque. highly recommend because it's gorgeous and well made but i would definitely come in and try it out for you"
1,I just received this in the mail and i was so surprised how flattering it is!  i ordered the print and i can see wearing this to work  out with friends or for date night!  perfect summer tank!  comfortable and flattering!  a great addition to my wardrobe! it fit true to size for me!
-1,Not a coat by any means  merely a thin wool boucle like sweater with a cheap thin synthetic lining ---and i also would never want the lining to be seen by anyone if i were to set the sweater on a chair or be helped in putting the thing on. the length and bulk is hard to layer under anything else and isn't pretty enough for a spring coat..sizing is also 2 sizes larger than anticipated.
-1,"I purchase this top of ""what i thought to be a beautiful denim tunic/top"" in a small on the sale rack with additional promo with beautiful details   but what is going on with the mid-section where there is at least 6 inches of space where there is no button or way to close the lower placket! and the lower bottom of placket is sewn shut so it makes the mid section bubble out  but why no buttons to close what would be a button down top???? you can slide your hand through this open space and it ope"
0,The lower part of dress bunches where buttons are  so the dress doesn't look flushed from top to bottom. i ended up returning it.
0,This is a super cute tunic - it is simply way too big.
-1,Unique jacket..... but when i put it on i felt and looked like charlie brown. this will be going back.
0,I ordered a m as the previous review said it ran small. i found it to be very large. i have more curves than the model and also thought it made me look boxy.
1,Really cute and comfy and casual skirt. i am looking forward to travelling in this skirt and running around for the summer. i did size down one size. highly recommend. will get lots of wear.
0,"Ordered this in xs my normal size (5'5"" 110 lbs) and it was huge! did not particularly care for the style either nothing special."
1,Like other reviewers  i tried on a medium and a large as i usually take either size in retailer dresses. the large was huge on me - i had an extra 6 inches or so on each side. the next medium that i tried on could barely fit over my head! i looked at the tag to see if i had picked up an extra small but it stated medium. got another medium and it fit perfectly. however  the cami underneath one medium was again teeny tiny. the other medium was ok. you may have to try on a few dresses to get the righ
-1,This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out  the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.
0,I bought this dress to attend a couple of summer weddings. it seemed like it would be a nice  light summer dress that i could wear all day. i do think it fits that qualification  however  it wasn't as flattering as i hoped. i'm generally pear shaped - small waist  larger hips. this dress does fit well over my hips  but does very little to show off my waist. overall  it is just ok.
0,Colors washed me out  i need more vibrant colors. so cute on the model
0,This dress is very good quality  with beautiful beading on the bodice. it's a heavier material than i was expecting  but that was a pleasant surprise. unfortunately  when i put it on and looked in the mirror  i laughed out loud because i looked like a fancy swiss milkmaid. the shoulders are puffier than shown on the model and  combined with the overall design and length  i couldn't think of anywhere to wear it. this is an easy return for me. the dress runs very true to size and the bodice is fit
-1,Beautiful color and the fabric is very substantial and soft. but  they didn't finish the bottom hem! the dress is lined and the bottom inside has a ribbon sewn in as a type of hem  but the actual edge is just cut and not turned in on itself. because of this the whole bottom had a hundred little fabric frays. the rest of the dress is so polished it just doesn't make sense. also  while the fabric is beautiful my dress had a weird mark on the chest  almost like a water mark. just overall bad attent
1,Great soft basic. low scoop neck makes this tank flirty while the thicker strap keeps it modest. i absolutely love this top  easily dress up and down!
-1,This shirt has absolutely no shape. look carefully at the model and you we discover she is cleverly positioned to hide the sheer boxy-ness of this shirt. the print is beautiful but it looks like a maternity shirt. i even ordered the xs at 5'7 and 130 lbs but found it too baggy. returned.
0,Probably should have returned this but it's just so pretty. i got complements from strangers the very first time i wore it but it's extremely long. tucking it in will be tough-where do you put all that length? aside from that it is beautiful. the embroidery is soft and delicate light blues  gold  neutrals. hard to see in the pic but there are textured polka dots all over the shirt. great buy-i just wonder how i'll wear it or if the length will be too much and it will become a 'closet sitter'.
0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.
-1,I ordered the blue version of this dress thinking the accent stripes were black. they were not ! they were wine colored. i liked the color  but not in combination with the other colors in the dress. black would have been a better look. i had to take it back. sad...
0,I'm actually surprised no one has reviewed this yet. i took the plunge because it seemed like a classic wardrobe staple  nothing too flashy or fancy  that would go well with many outfits. my thoughts below:  __________________  pros:  - fits tts. i'm normally either a 10 or 12 and got the large. it fit well and the elastic isn't too tight. fit very well for me because i have wider hips. so if you're straight or slim  you could probably size down.  - exactly as pictured. it does have a nice flow
1,This is such a lovely top and i am so happy i was able to snag it on sale! trust the other reviewers that it does run small! i am normally a 0 or 2 on top  and i got the 4 - and it's a bit snug! it is very fitted below the bust  but that's what makes it look so nice on. i would definitely recommend  but know that sizing is off.
-1,I was expecting a lot more  but this was disappointing. the material is thin and the quality isn't great. it also hung loose  just too loose  as it runs very very large i returned it
1,Such an adorable top. very flattering despite it's rather full style. just be sure you get the correct size since it does indeed run quite large. i normally wear a small  sometimes medium. i ordered both sizes to be sure but they were both too large! i sized down to xs and that fit perfectly.
0,I stumbled upon this item at my local retailer  and immediately had to true it on. the colors are so lovely in person. after trying it on  i was disappointed :( the material has a foamy/air feel to it  and the skirt seems to run small. needless to say  i didn't purchase this item.
-1,This sweater did not flatter a sz 12 with 36d chest. it's very well made but not for the curvy girl. this is my very first review and felt compelled to share my thoughts since i heavily rely on others' reviews before i purchase.
-1,"The fabric of this top is lovely. the fit not so. it does not fit as shown on the model. the fit is very large around the middle and fits more like a ""swing"" top. i am 5'9"" slim build. i ordered my usual size medium. shoulders and back fit perfectly. too much material around the middle. had it had a straight cut to it  as shown  i'd keep it. because it doesn't it's going back."
0,The geometrical pattern of this sweater is slightly asymmetrical  with nice geometry to it. the colors are more muted and subtle as compared to the picture. i was very excited to see it through its transparent bag. unfortunately my delight faded after i pulled the sweater out. first  it weighs a ton. a thread for each color runs around he whole sweater  hence much more thread went into it than in a typical sweater. second  it runs large. i am usually an xl or 16-18  but this sweater has lost of
-1,I splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed. i'm a 36d  and the l was so tight i couldn't get it over my chest. also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped.  and the fabric is shiny  the picture makes it look like it's matte. if it did fit like the model i would've loved it. the print is beautiful though. bummer
-1,The fabric is great. the design is fun. i thought the dress would be perfect for work and also wear for a fun night out. the fit was perfect up top but the bottom part was to full and a lot longer then i expected. so i had to return it.
1,"I do love this dress. i wore it for my 20th anniversary party and received numerous compliments. it's great for embracing your curves. it has a wonderful ""vintage-made-modern"" flair that classic retailer pieces always have. you do have to be careful when wearing it...jewelry or belts may snag the intricate lacework. i am definitely the type of shopper who waits for a sale. this is one of the few pieces i felt i could splurge on. it is just that unique. i hope that retailer continues to carry these t"
1,This is a beautiful blouse. great colors and detailing - i absolutely love the design in the back. will look great with white skinny jeans. it does run a bit on the short side but i have a long torso and it still works. i waffled between the 6 and 8 (am usually an 8 and a full b cup).  in sleeveless tops i really like the arm holes to be snug enough to cover that unattractive part between the underarm and breast  so i was considering the 6 but ultimately decided the 8 did so with a bit more comf
0,"I love the pattern (red motif) but the sizing of this dress is way off. the top fit fine but the hip area was so tight when standing with my legs hip-width apart. the only way it looked normal was if i stood with my feet together and thighs touching. i ordered my usual size 10 - for reference i am 5'9""  170# bra size 34f and 40-41"" hips."
-1,Loved loved loved the shirt but...the material was so thin
-1,Unfortunately this one is going back. the fit is very flattering and the underlying layer is very revealing in the back.
-1,This looks great on the model but when it arrived  i couldn't believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it  but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry.
0,I wanted to love this dress - it is gorgeous on the model  but unfortunately for me  it didn't fit right. i'm petite and ordered the xxs petite. it was snug in the upper body and looked like i was wearing a baby-doll dress. the material is high quality and i love the burnt red color. it just didn't fit right. definitely looks great on the model  but hung funny on me. i can see why it was highly rated  gorgeous dress - just not on me.
-1,"I wanted to love this dress! the material is beautiful! but sadly i agree with other reviewer. the model definitely has this pinned back! i am on the small side (5'5""  120 lbs  straight figure  very tiny ""girls"") and this dress looked awful. totally swallowed what little shape i have and the swing did make me look prego in front and back. the fabric is stiff so i think that adds to the sticking out oddly. as far as sizing the arm jokes fit great. xs ordered and length was good but wish the ""swin"
1,When i saw another shopper holding up this dress for assessment in my local retailer store  i knew i had to have it! i bought it in the red color and it is gorgeous. the fit was perfect...very flattering style. it can be dressed up or down depending on shoes and jewelry  or boots and a scarf! the detail of the scalloped v in the back is a beautiful addition. perfect for the holidays or even dinner out with friends! beautiful dress!
1,Dress is very flattering on  not tent-like at all!
0,This shirt runs large. i ordered it before it was sold in stores so i didn't return it. the style is really cute. the shirt does pill.
1,Sorry  but i disagree with a previous reviewer who wrote that this buttondown is sheer and runs large. as for sizing  i purchased my usual size small. the fit is intended to be a bit slouchy  and it fits perfectly through the shoulders and the bust. love the high/low hemline  and the back isn't too tight across my bum. i'll also note that i'm 57 years of age and might tend to be a little more modest when it comes to sheer fabrics. the see-through factor is not an issue with this buttondown. i'm
0,The material is awesome and it's a super pretty dress it just didn't work on my body.
-1,This shirt had an overpowering vinegar odor when i took it out of the packaging.    the mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much.
1,I love this top! yes  it is quite transparent  but just needs a light colored cami (i like the reversible scoop and v-neck tanks at retailer)! it's incredibly soft and light for summer time. the black motif is more like a slate gray contemporary pattern. i also really like the sewn in v-neck line. it gives the shirt a more professional touch. i'll be wearing it for work with a dark blue blazer.
-1,I really liked this dress in pictures online. i wanted to wear it to work on casual fridays. everything about this dress was a disappointment  especially at this price point. the fit was weird: tight in some places  too loose in others (i'm usually xs or s  i ordered this one is s). it's made out of a fairly thick and warm material  yet the neck area of the dress is more exposed than it appears in pictures  especially in the back  making it awkward to have this very warm dress with neck  upper b
1,"I initially purchased this shirt in the grey motif color  size l (my usual size  i'm 5'8"" size 14). unfortunately i found the shirt very roomy  but loved the pattern and style. so i ordered a medium and much to my surprise it fit much better. i'm very happy with my purchase."
0,"I really like the pattern and the cut of these pants. the fabric is nice  too. however  i was disappointed how much they stretched out the first (and only) time i wore them. i am 5'6"" and about 150 lbs. i ordered size 10; i am going to try to exchange them for a size 8 since they stretched so much."
-1,Very disappointed. the cutouts started to rip the first time i wore it. i've only worn it twice and i love it but the cut outs are embarrassing.
0,Sooooo soft! not a ton of shape but very versitile and warm!
1,Loved my. mustard colored ones so much  i also bought the ligher green color. fit is wonderful- and very flattering. they can be dressed up or down. they look great with heals or booties!
-1,I love the colors of this dress  and i waited for the sale since it isn't really good for work. i wear size 6 in hd all the time  but this one doesn't fit at all on the top. the bust is cut for someone really curvy  but the bottom is for someone really straight. i don't know what they were using for a model  but this has to be tried on before purchased. the material is also rough  and there is no lining to protect you from that. i love my hd dresses for style and functionality  but this one is j
1,I'm normally a small in retailer tops  but i could tell that this would run big. i'm glad i sized down to an extra small. this top is flowy and airy without being baggy. the colors are summery and beautiful. my only complaint is that it's a bit sheer  and i can see the outline of my bra in front. i will have to wear a cami underneath.
0,This top runs very large. i am a size 12/14 & purchased the size l. i could have easily fit in the size m. it's a pretty top in a comfortable knit fabric   but the size was overwhelming so i returned it.
-1,I took the advise of a reviewer and sized down to xs. i am 5'6 and 110. i could take them off without unbuttoning them  they were hugh  even the xs! they looked like a halloween costume. even at the discounted sale price  awful and kind of made me laugh. but i guess that's why they are still available at this sale price.
1,Beautiful white denim pants. the fit is perfect. fitted on the top with a nice flare on the bottom. very classy and versatile cut. paige denim runs long for me and these are no exception. will be getting them hemmed but i don't mind because they are perfect!
-1,These pants looked worn  washed & old looking when i received them! the quality is super thin cotton as if it's been washed a million times & is about to fall apart! the workmanship is terrible. you can see loose stitching all over. the top portion is too tight & looks terrible stretched out. i liked absolutely nothing about this pants except the idea of them from the picture online...
0,This dress is sort of a mixed-media dress. the top colored portion is a slinky knit that dolan uses all the time. i like it a lot. the bottom  is a tight silky twill-like weave. the silhouette is straight  which is what attracted me to it  but when i put it on  i realized that the waist wasn't going to work for me. the split came at a point too high for me to belt and the sleeves made my wide shoulders look dowdy. i am not a person that wants to put on a dress and have to style the heck out of i
0,This sweater is huge! i usually wear a small  ordered an extra small and i was still swimming in it. i like big sweaters  but i ended up returning it because the sizing looked ridiculous.
1,I purchased the teal/blue and the color is striking. though i put true to size the decorative top is slightly tight around the bust. and the bottom too is fitted and not flowy. for a looser fit you may want to size up. for a more fitted look it is true to size.
0,First off  this shirt is a hd in paris brand  not floreat. i love floreat clothing so that is why i initially bought this blouse. i like the idea and the coloring of the shirt. the biggest drawback for me was that it is completely see through. i just bring myself to get a strapless cami just to wear this one top. please change brand name.
1,Love this dress!!! i agree with the other reviewers  i had to size up one size  but then it was perfect. i'm 5'5  125 lbs. and the size 6 worked great.
-1,Dress just did not fit will around the hips.  also the string belt was defective - basically about to come off.  looks like someone may have wore it and returned it.  was not flattering at all.
1,I love these  but i should have ordered the size 25 instead of my usual 26. i can wear them higher with a tight belt  but they are still too long. too cute to return though.
-1,Very cute dress  but fabric is very flimsy and seams were very puckered which couldn't be pressed out.
1,"The lace detail adds a nice spin to an otherwise plain tank. looks great under a cardi  jacket  sweater coat... for the most part it fits true to size. it's not as fitted as i hope it would be. at 5'1""  115lbs  i got my usual xsp. my biggest gripe is the very deep v-neck--its shows my bra. eek. it's like the strap could be shortened to help remedy it but then it may leave the arm hole too small or bring it too high up. perhaps it may shrink in the wash or i just need to get bigger boobs. maybe t"
1,I have been looking for a summer dress with a bit of a chic flair to it- i was thinking black  tank top dress. after weeks of hunting for the idea in my head  i started to branch out. i reluctantly tried this on thinking it would be 'baggish'  plain  and possibly too short. wow was i wrong!! this dress is everything + more. wear with some wedges  belt it (although it doesn't need it at all!)  layer a high neckline lace top over it  the possibilities are endless. although i loved the green  the b
1,Cute design. details on shoulder make the tshirt more special but it runs large so that kind of takes away from the styling. got it on super sale  so i'll keep it. maybe a wash will shrink it a bit...
0,"I've been searching for a pretty and unique ""party top"" and thought this was it. it is beautiful and unique but much too cropped for me and i'm only 5'3"". sadly i had to return. maybe would be more appropriate on someone younger"
0,As other reviewers have pointed out  the bum is not flattering. the pockets are wide and the fit sort of flattens you out. bummer. literally. too bad  i wanted these to work more than then coh's parker cropped. the coh's win. my wallet loses.
