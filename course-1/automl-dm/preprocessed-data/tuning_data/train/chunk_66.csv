1,I wear between a l and xl..i chose the xl which was the right choice..if you are a bit curvy in proportions  i could size up. the color is gorgeous...i just logged back on to order another if there were options  but alas  there are not. flattering arm cut! could be worn for work  or with jeans/ out to dinner. it's cute  you won't regret it! (as a side note  it is sheer...which you can see in the photo. needs a cami)
1,I was so excited about the arrival of my maza dress. much to my surprise the material was not has structured as i thought it would be from the photos. the fit was very tight and did not fall as nicely as i anticipated. because i loved the classic design i decided to give it another chance so i returned it for the next size up and fell in love  the open sleeve was a nice surprise with a touch if elegance. the front buttons added a bit of old charm and feminine appeal. while the material was not v
1,"This vest is super cute! i'm 5'5"" 120 and usually wear an xs at retailer  i have this in a small and it fits perfectly  fits snug when zipped  my usual xs would have definitely been too tight. would definitely recommend!"
-1,"This dress was too cute to pass up! i loved it online but when i got it home  it was so tight i couldn't zip up my normal size. the length was perfect on me being 5'7"". the fabric and detail was beautiful. if you have a bust  order a size up. beautiful dress just really snug up top."
-1,This top was too big for me. 5'4  135lbs and ordered xxs. fit was fine and wanted it too work  but too overwhelming on me as well. will be going back.
-1,I love the idea of this top and ordered it in white. it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans. the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel. i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking. if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made  then it would have been a winner!
1,I have had my eye on this dress since the spring (in yellow)  but it sold out quickly. i jumped on this dress as soon as i saw it come out in different colors this fall! i purchased the peach color and it is really lovely. i will be wearing this dress for family photos. the lace and the details are so very pretty! i am usually a size 0 or 2  and purchased in size 2 since there is no stretch to it. it is a beautiful dress and i highly recommend it! wish it came in white!
1,This sweater is beautifully detailed  however  it seems too spring like to be for sale before christmas. very pretty. the cut may not be for everyone. it is like a peplum on the bottom and looks best open  as shown  on my busty top (36d) it seems cut slightly large but i am keeping my usual size medium. i'll keep for early spring! colors are as shown  detail better in person.
1,I feel like i have a lot of blouses like this so it really needed to wow me to keep it. and while it is lovely  well made and very pretty and delicate...i just didn't feel like it was anything special. if you don't have a blouse like this  then it is a great find. but it is nothing super out of the ordinary... fit i feel is tts...i am in between a m and l...i ordered the l. lots of room in the body although i didn't like where the arms hit on me. they aren't wrist length but they aren't mid-fore
0,I was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality. the quality of the material is not very good. i've bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and they're very soft and very well made  hence my disappointment. i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress.
1,I have featured a picture below. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. i ordered an xs petite. i'm pretty busty so i don't like a loose fitting top  so ordering a size down did the trick. it's super soft  one of a kind and the edging of the neckline is delicate looking and soft and therefore adds a feminine element. i'm enjoying wearing the top.
1,I ordered these in the blue size 28p. i am 5' 120 lbs. a size 6p and curvy. the jeans fit very nicely in thigh and hip area (and i don't have skinny thighs). the jean is not a low rise which is what i was looking for. i was looking for a jean that was a little dressier yo wear out to grab a drink or catch a movie. these jeans fit the bill because they give off a polished vibe  especially when paired with a dressier top  blazer  skinny belt and heels. also  i like that the jeans don't have the to
1,I just received the top today  and will send back for a larger size. i am i between a 4 and 6  so tried the 4 thinking it would be boxy. it is very fitted with no opening to assist in pulling over shoulders. i am hoping the 6 is only slightly bigger. the shirt also had a slight musty odor. it's a rather thin chambray....with 3/4 sleeves. the top came to just the top of my jeans  which should work for higher waisted skirts or layering.
1,"I can't wait for our warmer weather to arrive here in minnesota so i can wear this lovely tank top. the style is so flattering  it doesn't bag out to make you look pregnant. the back yoke is solid navy blue chiffon which is a nice touch. soft fabric  drapes beautifully. the armholes are not oversized. the fabric is opaque so no camisole required.    i am 5'5"" and 120 lbs. and 36a. i purchased size small."
0,I loved this top when i saw it online. i was able to go in the store and try it on and sadly  it is not the top for me. if you have a large chest  then this top will gather at your cleavage and give an awful appearance. the fabric falls in and even the sales associate agreed that it was unsightly. if i were an a or b  this probably would have worked. i should have known to stay away from a pleated top.
-1,This is adorable but if it truly has to be dry-cleaned that is deal killer
-1,I wore this for the first time today  and after just about an hour  it gently nicked something and got a hole in the pack.  its so disappointing as i love they style and its so comfortable. very poor quality for the price :(
-1,This skirt is very short. i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle. that's quite off because i'm only 5 feet tall  and i wore it pretty low on the hips. it also flares out awkwardly below the knee. there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem. i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt. plus  the fabric--while thick and beautiful and stretchy--has a
-1,This dress is so cute in the photo and fit true to size  but the material is slinky and felt cheap. the stitching was also poor quality. i am so thankful that retailer will let us order a batch  try on and return in store...this went back.
-1,"I was looking for a really warm  but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area. i tried on a size small  which is my usual coat size. while the coat fit  it was not flattering. for reference i am 5'9"" 128 pounds and usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer tops. in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on. the front material is doubled  which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach. the shoulders are bulky and"
0,I need t-shirts  these seem cute. a small runs loose  but it's comfortable and it does fit. i am turned off by the little side slits on all of this brand's printed tees. if i want to do a partial tuck to give myself a waist  because these shirts are cut generously  the little slits just throw the whole look off. i tried a few in the store  but left them all there.
-1,If i could sew  i'd take the fabric from this skirt and make it into a different shape (after ordering a bigger size). the fabric is just as it appears online -- totally gorgeous with almost a quilted feel to it. however  this thickness means the skirt sticks out like something judy jetson would wear. it's also too small in my go-to skirt size (and i order a lot at retailer). the waist and hips are small (making the skirt too short as well)  but the bottom flares out ridiculously. i ordered two of
-1,These are light and airy and pretty. they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed.    they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin  therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them... or turn over in bed in them.    when i sit  the slits fall down around my thighs. my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way
0,Great color and quality but very boxy. even with the drawstring there is no shape going on here.
0,"I love the design and color of this cardigan  and the way it was styled in the store display made me snatch one up right away. but unfortunately  it's huge and shapeless (i tried size xs/s) and i'm a waif (5'2""  105#) - i think it could drape nicely on a tall woman but if you are small to average in height it'll hang down somewhere mid-thigh or even lower. you can snug up the ties  as they are threaded through the cardigan like a drawstring  but that just made it look bunchy and even more shapel"
0,Cute but too thick and rough
-1,Poor quality  material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured.
-1,"Ah! i wanted to love this but without anything under it (as pictured)  the petite sizing reveals way too much side boob. i am 5'3"" and a small b cup. i ordered an xs petite. it fits but there isn't enough material under the armpits. the fabric and design is great other than this flaw. sadly returning."
-1,This top could've been one of my favorites ever. i ordered the rose option and was planning on ordering another color. the fabric is super thin but i was able to wear w/o an extra tank. unfortunately after 2 wears  several small holes appeared around the neck/under the ruffle. i washed this top on hand wash cycle and hung to dry. when i came to read the reviews  i noticed i wasn't the only customer with this issue.
1,I was so excited to see these pants on sale. they fit beautifully and drape well. the hidden lining of 'shorts' is a great feature and i will get 3 seasons of use from these.  now if i could only get them in plain black too ....
0,I have been looking for a quality pair of black skinny jeans for a while. after reading the reviews  i had such high hopes for these jeans. i bought it in my usual size 28 and while the top part fit perfectly  i found that the bottom was too tapered in and ultra skinny making it not look right. sadly  i had to return.
0,I am somewhere between a 24 and a 25 (i have narrow hips but an average waist)  so i was happy to find that these worked for me in me in a 0. i loved the blue color as an interesting neutral. they did stretch out a little with wear  but i still felt like i looked good by the end of the day. i typically really like cotton/linen blends as i can usually wear them out of the dryer if i'm going for a casual look - a few wrinkles with linen doesn't bother me. but these. oh my. when i pulled them out o
-1,I loved these and wore them once (i bought the red ones) and the stained my furniture and my shirt so i washed them a few times in hopes of getting out all the extra dye- ruined yet another chair!!! so annoyed. i loved them but they are not worth it.
1,"I agree with the other reviewer that the color isn't as pink in person and more subtle. my thoughts below on some other things:  __________  pros:  - pockets! makes it so fun and chic with the overall style.  - the material is lovely and breathable. i didn't find it sheer at all! of course  i didn't wear it outside the dressing room. the material is thicker but it hangs on the body well.  - runs ""mostly"" tts. i only tried on the medium and it fit everywhere being slightly tighter in the chest. i"
1,I really likes these jeans. they are comfortable with stretch and look cute. the price is high but an investment for sure !
1,This shirt feels so nice  it's heavier weight and so soft.. i think it's lyocel... such a great drape to the shirt that is so flattering. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and 34c/d and purchased a size 4. found this item to be true to size  if not slightly loose  but i love the flow of it. highly recommend  the green is classic and timeless  very versatile.
1,I really loved the uniqueness of this dress  and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work  but it was just a little too fitted for the office!
1,I love this jumpsuit! it runs a little large but still works for me. it makes it super comfy and a great piece for every day!
-1,"These are horrible pants!!! they run small in the thigh and butt like other cartonnier crops. look great at first....after a few hours of wear the stretch out everywhere!!! absolutely terrible! i have several pairs of cartonnier crops that are my ""go to"" pants  but these are not worth even the sale price! i'd give them no stars if i could!! this fabric is very different from my other printed pairs. if u must try them  size down and suffer through the first few ""tight"" hours! trust me...they will"
0,These pajama pants are beautiful but very sheer and very delicate.  not ideal for a mom with kids
0,"I like the feel  stretch and softness of this dress  it's very comfortable. sadly  as others have commented  the armhole openings are just too long causing the dress to fit and look a little off around the chest area on me. i considered sizing down to a 4  but it fit beautifully other than the armhole area. unfortunately it will have to go back. i am 5'7"" 120 lbs  34d and ordered a 6."
1,"I loved this dress as soon as i tried it on  but... it bunched up weird in the front around my hips. i ordered a second size 4  hoping that it would fit better. but same thing. if i tried to go to a size 6 it would be too big every where else. fyi - i'm 5'8"" 129lbs and i'm a runner. it's not like i have a huge backside or anything. my guess is sizing is off. i've tried another of his dresses and it fit perfectly."
0,When these shorts arrived i loved them and was so excited to wear them on my upcoming trip to the beach. the high rise waist is very flattering and the material was extremely soft. the floral detailing was a little more orange than in the picture but i still loved the contrast. the first time i wore these i immediately noticed threads coming loose throughout the day. it was minor but still concerning for an item that was so costly. the real problem arose in the evening when i put on a jacket on
-1,I got these in the mail today and to me  they look exactly like the pants my mamaw used to wear in the 80s. they were super comfy but not cute at all on me. they do run large like other reviews say. i am usually an 8/10 or med and these in the small were the right choice. going back because they just look horrible on me though
-1,I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it's basically cut for model-sized people only. it's short and wide  and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i can't imagine this will look good on most women.
0,I chose this dress to try to flatter an hourglass figure  but was disappointed. the fabric is a beautiful soft  fine silk  but unforgiving. the cut is not truly a wrap  and  with a fixed thin elastic waistband  was too short waisted for me. while the model looks elongated  the thin line under my bust created two poofy sections... not flattering at all. while i was drawn to the shape for my body type  it may be better suited to another. happy hunting!
0,"I am 5'8"" 140 lbs.  34b  and i ordered the 6 in denim. the dress is certainly tts: the 6 fit like a glove but wasn't at all tight. perhaps my expectations were too high with this dress--based on the other reviews  i thought that it would be perfect for my pear-shaped figure. however  i found that the a-line skirt accentuated my lower half  thereby making me look larger than i am  so i sent it back. otherwise  this is a great dress. it certainly did manage to hide lumps and bumps in spite of bein"
1,This dress is absolute perfection. the quality of the dress is great  the fit is comfortable and it's such a fun summer dress. the slip underneath fits perfectly the outer layer is delicate yet durable.
1,I love this dress. i am an hourglass and found this dress to be super flattering and such a unique find. i usually avoid pockets in front like this  but it works on this dress. so happy i found it.
1,I am tall and this sweater is a great length. very flattering  slightly loose across the tummy. i have the red/mauve color and may order the gray too. super soft   medium weight sweater- very versatile. love
0,I really want to like this dress - it's beautiful  but it just fits like a sack. the yoke exaggerates my bust and the dress makes me look 20 lbs heavier. perhaps if you are tall and thin like the mode  or small chested  it would be great! the quality and color is beautiful.
-1,I recently purchased this blouse on their 40% off sale in white. i was hoping for a crisp white structured blouse. i did read all the reviews and thought i would give it a try anyway. it is awful. there is no structure or shape but the quality is the reason i am returning. it feels like a napkin or thinner. not even worth the extra sale price. i will be returning.
0,When i tried it on it looked like a stiff bathrobe. straight  too boxy.
-1,My conscience screamed at me not to buy this sweater and i wish i had listened! i noted the fact that it was acrylic and also the fact that it was oversized. but i also loved the design and can't resist anything with mustard yellow. i was instantly disappointed when i received it  almost didn't even try it on. how can they possibly charge $185 for terrible itchy 80's acrylic? it looks cheap  it feels cheap and it didn't even fit well. only redeeming quality: easily returnable!
0,"This dress looked so cute on the model  but unfortunately not so much on me. it appeared so much more fitted in the picture than it actually is. i ordered the xs and it is huge on me. definitely a tunic/swing style  rather than streamlined. my husband said it looked frumpy on me. it is also longer than it appears on the modei. for reference i am 5' 4""  i wish this would have worked  but i need something more fitted for my body type. if you are looking for an unfitted tunic style  this could be s"
0,"The shirt looks a lot less fitted on the model in the picture than how it fit in ""real"" life. size was not wrong  the material was just very clingy. i was not impressed and subsequently returned it."
0,When i received the dress i went to try it on and one of the loops for the string to cinch the dress broke. guess that's gonna have to go back
1,This coat is really beautiful  and pictures don't do it justice. it runs very large. i'm normally an xl or l in sweaters  but because of the balloony shape  i actually took a medium - even then it looks like i'm being enveloped  so i prefer to wear it unsnapped.
1,Bought these in both moss and navy. fits perfect  love the style and the roll down waist. excellent quality.  bought the peachy color top with the elephants to wear with the moss colored one and received lots of compliments.
-1,The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic. the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn't seem right to me. it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright  but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl. i will be returning the sweater because of that.
0,"1. the wide leg/crop is a cool trend. but not great on me. i'm pretty standard in size/build: 5'6""  135 lbs   size 4. i felt like i just looked oddly shaped with them on.  2. and maybe this is the issue: the size 27 (my normal size in every citizen pant i own) was about 2 whole sizes too big for me. i mean  i felt great about myself. but...wowza.  3. when i took them to the store to try on/exchange  they don't even carry them in the store! so i just returned and will try something else."
-1,I sized way down and this top was still shapeless and tent-like. the sweatshirt fabric overpowered the cute  feminine details.
1,I got this top in the beige  size small. it is flattering and though i hadn't noticed the lace details in the back before i purchased it  they are a nice touch. this is a versatile piece. i can dress it up or down. this will definitely be a favorite of mine this season.
0,This is a cute tee but only if you get it on sale. i don't love the material. it seems flimsy and likely to get holes quickly. the pattern is pretty cute but nothing special. glad i got it on sale. as with all retailer tees  size down. xs works good for me.
0,Gorgeous but just too short in length for anyone with a long torso.  i sized up to get more length  but then the neck opening was way too big and hung open to expose - well  everything up top.  wearing a cami would be an option but would take away from the dressiness of the top.  i had to leave without this item  but was disappointed because i love the colors and cut otherwise!
0,Maybe if i sized down to a small i'd like them better.. they look ok from the front. but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide. there is exceess material in the back and leg hole. they are not all flattering to my rear end. overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling. too expensive (with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive) for the lack of structure and simplicity.
-1,The zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it. very disappointing since i love the design. i'm actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger  but annoying that it's come to that.
1,Very cute top. the sleeves were more quarter length on me. looks great with jeans
0,I love the colors of the teal dress  but i wish that the top only had one color. the design is cute but the construction is a little off. the transition from the top to the skirt seems to lay wrong or have a bit of extra fabric. sizing up or down didn't help. the top is lined but the bottom is very thin. the bottom should be lined too. not the best.
0,I saw these in my local retailer and loved them on the hanger. when i tried them on  not so much. the material is a pretty substantial white denim and very stretchy (i didn't find them to be that smooth of a fabric  but more of a traditional denim texture). i am a 6-8 in pants  and normally wear a 27 in pilcro denim. when i tried on the size 27 in the store  i found them to be very tight in the thighs - and i don't have big thighs. i also found the pants to pull conspicuously across the crotch are
-1,I'm sure there's someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasn't me. admittedly  i'm a less than ideal body type at a curvy 5' tall. still for a taller person this shirt runs short  for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist  for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful  for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look  and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit. c
-1,When i wore this the two times i did  i got a ton of compliments. it runs small  and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning. after the second wear  the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable. i have to return it and am so disappointed. sadly  i would not recommend buying it for that reason.
