1,The top runs small  it is a very sexy and slimming top. i tried in l  it was too small so i have ordered it in xl. i hope it fits because it is very fitted and i am worried that the bottom will roll to the top with a fabric like this. but it is a very sexy  good looking  and slimming top. i love it!!
0,I saw the shirt at my local retailer store and loved the color and print; however  the shirt had way too much fabric!  i was swimming in it.  it was not flattering whatsoever.  plus  it's overpriced for a shirt.  i'm sadly returning it.
1,I saw this in the store on a beautiful autumn saturday afternoon and was inspired for what i wanted to add to my wardrobe for the season. this blouse is just fun without being loud or overpowering. the coloration works beautifully with my wardrobe and i can wear this dressed up or dressed down; with skirts  leggings  trousers  jeans...with a vest  jacket  or sweater or on its own. it is substantial enough not to wrinkle and look sloppy  it is easy to launder and will travel well with my capsule
-1,"I ordered this in the ""plum"" color  which in real life just looks like a very  very dark brown. that would probably be okay  but the dress is actually about 3 inches shorter than the listed measurements. i ordered the regular length  but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thigh...way  way too short. i am 5'5""  for reference. lastly  i think the fabric is just awful quality  especially for this price point. the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself - worn ou"
0,I ordered this sweater in xxsp and the sweater is still very large on me. it is definitely a sweater that is supposed to hang off of your shoulders  however  i'm finding that it wants to fall all the way off of me. the quality is nice. it is medium in weight. it has a cottony feeling  but it not super soft. it looks way better on the model shown than in person to me. i wanted to love it  but i only just like it. i think others will like this if you are looking for a fun  loose look in a sweater.
0,I got the red  which was short sleeved. the shirt itself was so cute  but the fit is very boxy. i got a small and it was way too wide. far wider and shorter in the waist than the picture shows. i am sad to return  but it makes me look like a square. (shape that is)
0,Glad i got this on sale. it is more yellow than the photo & short. it is also heavy with a sueded interior. would have given more stars if it was less boxy & longer.
-1,"I had been waiting for this skirt to go on sale as i fell in love with the style and print on the website. however  after receiving it in the mail i was disappointed to find that the cut was all wrong for my body type. i am 5'6""  size 4  hourglass/athletic. the xs was too big and made me look like i had no shape. would be cute on a girl with no hips/booty but unflattering on hourglass figure."
0,This is baggy on me in my regular size. this happens to be a good thing because it's also very thin...tissue thin... material. the reason that's a good thing is i can wear another t- shirt under it with all that extra room and it hangs nicely. i'm hoping it shrinks a bit when i wash it in hot water.the design on the front is the only real reason i'm keeping it.
0,I bought this jumpsuit in both fabrics. i adored the fit and feel of both  but sadly  the graphic fabric was not handled well in the construction. three examples: a thin white piece along one leg seam made it look like a hole; mismatched large pieces of white in the crotch area looked sloppy and wrong; worst of all  a diagonal was placed on both breast pieces  but they were different angles  which again looked sloppy and wrong in a place where you really want it to look neat and right. too bad b
1,This shirt is wonderful! i love the styling and the print. sure to be a favorite!
0,"So the dress is interesting. has an asymmetrical wrap look  short  sexy length (i'm 5'3"" and the petite barely covers my assets)  and a neckline that implies sexy without actually displaying the girls- it crosses over and stays closed  but looks sexy and plunging. but the shoulders are what make it look matronly. they're wide- from neck out to the outer edge of my shoulder/upper arm. they show no shoulder at all  which is really an odd design when the rest of the dress is sexy-ish. i looked back"
0,This tee is cute  keep in mind the white is totally sheer. but it's huge. i ordered an xxs and it's very loose and drapey  which is likely the style but when did sizing get to unrealistic? also  a totally sheer  basically a sort of fancier cotton tee for $60? no way.
-1,These run at least 2 sizes smaller than other styles of the same brand  mother. such a bummer because the quality is totally on point. i'm going to exchange them for a huge size i guess. whatever  i don't mind having a size that's so much larger than all my other jeans. i just mind the complete hassle of the exchange process. i wish mother would get their sizing issues under control. it's not retailer's fault. so annoyed.
-1,I waited for this dress to go on sale and when it did i bought it right away. i am disappointed!!! the lace fabric is very stiff. i should have listened to the previous reviewer. i feel like it is poking out on my arms and neck. although i appreciate the careful placements of flowers on the dress  had the fabric been different  i think it would be a great dress.
-1,I was so excited to receive this jumpsuit as it looks so elegant and i love the lattice back. as soon as it arrived i set about unbuttoning it to try it on. 10 minutes and 2 broken fingernails later i got done. when i tried it on i found that it fit everywhere except the bust which was much too tight and i am not a busty person. so back it goes. even if it had fit  i do not think i could have handled the hassle of those buttons. why they didn't design it with a hidden zipper on the side and kept
0,Another shirt i really wanted to love. i adore green but so few tops are made in this color. (please make more!!) however  this shirt didn't work for me. i think it's a matter of where your curves live. the shirt was true to size  but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model  and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery. sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on. probably a great shirt for different body types. would love to see more green clothing....
1,Love this tunic. very comfortable and a perfect length to the knee. i wore it to a birthday party with brown booties. the green moss color is perfect for the fall in new england. can't wait to wear it again.
0,I bought this shirt with the intentions of using it as a nursing top. to that effect  i'm happy with the purchase  and will get a lot of use out of it. i bought two on blush and one blue at the same time. however  i was surprised that the shirt was so open and loose. i thought it was just a deep v-neck  but the design actually really opens up once the hook and eye is undone at the top. you are then very exposed  there is nothing but an opened front shirt. this is convenient for a nursing mother 
0,The colors are beautiful and the fabric is very soft and comfortable. i will be returning because of issues with length and being low cut.    for reference i am 5'5 145lbs  38-30-40  34ddd. the dress was low cut and showed too much cleavage for my comfort  but this may not be an issue for women with smaller breasts (or if you don't mind some cleavage showing). this length was also a bit too long  so if you are 5'5 or shorter you may want to order the petite size.
0,"I ordered this sweater in a medium with high hopes. i'm 5'8"" and slender  but with a 36' bust  and the medium was too loose and long (sleeves fell past my wrists). i would exchange this for a small for a better fit  but the color is not the white or cream color i was expecting. the color of this sweat is more of an oatmeal - not flattering on a far-skinned blonde. i think the color would look fantastic on someone with dark hair (as it does on the girl in the photo). the texture is great and i re"
-1,"The photos online make it look like a comfortable  relaxed  lightweight early fall/spring cardigan. when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no ""shimmer"" as far as i can tell. i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out  but it didn't work. it looks too rumpled and i don't want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed."
1,"I love this top! although  i wish i had ordered the large rather than the medium. i am 5'4""  138 pounds and a 34d. the medium just fits but is ever so slightly snug across my shoulders. it will work; though i will probably have it dry cleaned rather than risk shrinkage by washing at home."
-1,I love the design  that's why i'm going back for a smaller size. i bought a medium and that size was made for someone 50 lbs heavier than i. usually i'm good at choosing my size online  but not today. if you are curvy and round like me still go for a smaller size because this dress has a lot if room. also i wish more clothes would come into the stores to try on  please!
0,This dress is a bit scratchy  but overall i liked the fabric well enough. on someone blond and fair  the peach color washes out a bit. the issue for me with the dress is that front is just too short for my height (i'm 5 9 1/2). it looked a bit obscene.     the small otherwise fit me great. i have broad shoulders  small chest and and slim.
0,This dress pattern and material are great - it's just way too big. i even tried an xs and it looked like a huge sack on me. too bad  it had some real potential.
-1,Runs big and looked unflattering. i am petite  might work on someone taller.
-1,I loved the way this shirt looked when i tried it on in the store buto when i got home i realized it's extremely sheer. you can't wear a white bra with it  for example because it will show through. taking it back.
1,"The patters/colors on this dress are much more stunning in person. it is lined and feels very well made. the pockets don't add bulk to the hip area as many times they do  which is great. the fit can be tricky if you have any semblance of curves. if you can  try this one on in a store before buying. for reference: i am 5'7""  have broad shoulders  am pear shaped (i have hips and a good sized rear end)  34b bust  weigh 145 lbs.  and generally wear a size 6 or 8 for tops and bottoms. the size 8 fit"
1,Lovely top that seems to flatter all body types. fit is great  fabric is soft  style is lovely...great to dress up or throw on with jeans.
1,This dress is exactly what i was looking for. i have a very business casual job but wearing jeans and blouses can get boring so i'm constantly on the lookout for easy  go-to dresses that i can throw on year round with flats  booties  sandals  etc. this dress is exactly what i had in mind and i look forward to wearing it in the fall/spring with booties and in the winter with tights.
1,These short are the best! the denim is incredibly soft. they go perfect with both casual and nice tops. i would wear them out everyday if i could.
0,Very high quality dress. there are two layers  (the under navy and over white crochet) which makes this worth the price. however it is very straight  making the dress fit like a bag if you have hips or boobs. tried petite and regular and both were too baggy even in xs.
0,"So this is a gorgeous dress  but it seems to have too many elements. i wish they had left off the white lacy decoration at the neckline because it seems to make the dress more ""girly"" than ""sleek."" i am short  so perhaps the multiple design features would be better on a tall woman than on me."
-1,I really wanted to like this shirt the quality is amazing and much prettier in person but it is hard to take care of. if you wash it the wrinkles are horrible so it has to be dry clean only. also the back is ridiculously long it looks very odd from the side view.
-1,"Wanted to love this- i did love the color and thought the style would work for anyone. but i tried it on and immediately took it off with a definite ""not keeping this."" the side zipper- a complaint by many  really made it uncomfortable. also  the detail under the bust would not lay flat and just looked odd. loved the material and definitely the green print. but i knew i would never wear it. just looked blah."
-1,I love the colors and style of this poncho  however  the fabric is a total miss.  it is so scratchy  i developed a serious rash within the first 1/2 hour of wering it. also  unfortunately  the fabric is not woven tightly  so the poncho does not keep you warm  the wind whips right through it. it is disappointing that while the styles of retailer have remained top  the quality of their clothing has steadly gone down the hill. i hope retailer will put more effort in bringing the quality back.
-1,Looked really cute on the hanger  so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft  and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it.
1,While shopping with my daughters  i bought this tee in white. i immediately felt guilty for spending too much on a white tee that was thin and see-through enough that i'd need to wear something underneath. i returned the white  but then retailer had a sale weekend  so i ordered the blue with a discount  so less guilt and the color is beautiful. i don't need to worry about wearing anything underneath - the fabric is very thin and super soft and feels so nice.
-1,I built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers: moss  copper and burgundy. they are soft  well-fitting  pretty linings and very satisfactory. this new version is stiff material  and ill-fitting. not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better  but it is too full across the front. with the stiff materials  this is a bad fit. disappointing and going back.
1,I usually wear a medium  and this jacket was no exception. the jacket is a shorter style as pictured. it is still flattering  even though it is a little boxy. i got the grey  which is a dark gray/slight greige color. if you like edgier over boho  this is a cute transitional jacket.
-1,The fabric is too sheer  also looks like sleepwear. just not my thing.
-1,The shirt is very big. it would be cute as a maternity shirt.
1,I was a bit dubious of the top because online the video of it made the top look frumpy - wide and wrinkled looking. the top seemed shorter in the video than in the pictures. so i wondered if the images were massaged a bit in photoshop. i got it today and it's fully lined and the material is pretty thick which gives it a rich look and feel. i like the top even though it highlights my hips a bit and being pear-shaped i don't normally like that  but being thin helps. the best part of the top is the
-1,The sides scooped up a bit too much on me. i was hoping to be able to tuck this into a skirt and wear to work  but there were definitely some gaps that showed the side of my midriff. back it goes. :(
0,Beautiful dress  but it just didn't look that flattering on me. the quality was nice and it looked just like the picture. unfortunately it just looked shapeless on me so i had to return it. the dress is probably more flattering if you have long legs to show off  i definitely don't!
-1,I wanted to love this sweatshirt  but alas  it is going back. upon opening and unfolding  the first thing i noticed: the dots and not solid. they are sort of distressed looking  with parts of them missing. secondly  it doesn't have a lot of structure. it's soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way. it's just not flattering on me. it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house. for reference  i ordered the 3  and i'm usually a 10/12 in tops.
1,"Call my corny but this dress inspires me to run barefoot through the lavender fields in provence.  the flowy layers and dreamy prints are mesmerizing.  fit is ideal for my body type as long as you size down.  i had no weird sagging  bagging or poofiness.  and i love the macrame belt!  i tied it offset to the side but the dress looks good unbelted too.  i purchased the small petite.     my stats for fit reference:  5'3"" tall  140#  36dd  28"" waist  35"" hips  wide rib cage  size m/l tops  size s/m"
1,Fell in love with this romper online  but since a few reviewers mentioned it ran large  i wanted to try it on in the store. this romper is even better in person! extremely flattering  delicate details and lined! it's adorable! i am glad i tried it on in the store. i am usually a size 6/medium  but the small worked better for me. i know this will be a staple of mine all spring and summer.
-1,Fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and ordered it right away. however i was sadly disappointed once it arrived. while the cut is cute  the fabric is just all wrong. i was expecting a nice  heavy knit-like material  but this feels and looks really cheap - especially given the price of the dress. sadly it is going back.
-1,I bought a size small in this dress even though i am usually a large at retailer. it just hung strangely and clung to the unflattering parts of my body but seemed very large. i loved the feel  color (grey) and style of the dress  but i ended up returning it because of the fit. it also requires something under it since it is fairly see-through.
0,This skirt looks exactly as pictured and fits great. i purchased it a few weeks ago and got lots of compliments on it. however  on the third wear  the side zipper split wide open. needless to say  it was returned.
1,I honestly just love the hanky panky brand. i know it sometimes feels a little extravagant to purchase their lingerie  but the quality  fit and style are so good that it is absolutely worth it. this piece is no exception. i don't normally purchase lingerie like this  but saw this chemise and decided to try it. just as the other pieces from this brand  it's comfortable and gorgeous- so high quality and classy. it's a great cut  the fabric is clearly lace  but beautifully done. and the feel is lov
1,This was an impulse purchase for me. a year ago i would have never considered a jumpsuit but they are growing on me. i had yet to find one that fit without too much need for tailoring. this one did the trick! i like that the cut is in such a way that you can wear a normal bra underneath it without it showing. the fabric itself is very lightweight so i would recommend a bra for some support. i like that the fabric is incredibly lightweight so you can wear it on a hot summer day. the jumpsuit is l
-1,"Soooo disappointed in this dress. the colors are beautiful for fall. the fabric feels luxe. the slip fits perfectly. the dress however is a hot mess. it is easily two times more fabric than needed to create a flow-y aline dress. huge everywhere. under the arms  and waist and hips. it's just an enormous tent. i am 5'8""  128 lbs. i ordered my usual size small. i looked shapeless in this. i can't think of any body type it would flatter. potentially  women quite far along in their pregnancy."
1,In truth  it looks better in the photo. i am sure it was a great value for the money i spent. however  i am keeping it because it will match perfectly with a pair of satin pants i want to wear to holiday parties.
1,This dress is a nice twist on a luncheon/work dress. can pair with blazer or sweater  and it looks really cute with hair styled up - almost throwback.    zipper sometimes gets a little caught on the lace top  but overall i'm really happy with this dress!
-1,These jeans are adorable! i'm so sad they didn't fit. my legs are bigger than the rest of my body  but i usually have good luck with wide leg pants. if you are looking for wide legs  these are not the jeans for you!
1,The most important thing is that my husband said he really liked the dress when i put it on.
1,This is a beautiful  light-weight summer top. i ordered the white - perfect for summer. very feminine. true to size. i am 117 5'3 34b and the x-small fit perfectly.
0,I think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i don't know how i would use this top. i don't mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops (if people see my bra slightly so be it) but this is really sheer  unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this  and in my mind  that defeats the purpose of a lightweight  sleeveless top. i returned it and was sorry to have to do that.
-1,Ordered this vest on line and returned it due too poor quality .
0,I really wanted to love it but it was way too maternity on me. i love flowy but the flow on this dress hit me in all the wrong places. but i must say i have a 34ddd bust and wear a medium regularly. well i sized down and ordered a small and it just didn't work. it just flowed right off my chest to what looked like a dress concealing a baby bump. overall its cute just not for me.
0,Fabulous fabric  adorable details. fitting is very  very odd. it's non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose  but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over  the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i'd get a larger size  but then i can't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall 
1,This top caught my eye in the store due to the beautiful print and lovely fabric. the photo really doesn't do it justice. i happened to have on a pencil skirt when i tried it on and the top looked great with my skirt though i will probably wear it more often with jeans or pants. it's a stunner!
0,This top runs small across the top. i was amazed at the material--polyester  i am sure--because the price was so high. it has a sheer layer underneath  which i think would make it hot in the summer. i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online.
-1,It's a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost it's shape. very disappointed. i am going to return top.
1,I really loved the material and the feel of this item  however it does run very large. even though it is meant to be loungewear it is great as a top with skinny jeans or leggings.
0,As another reviewer mentioned the quality isn't here.  they pilled in the thighs after wearing once and stretched out so much at the end of the day i was pulling them up constantly.  such a bummer because i love this brand.
0,I'm still on the fence about these. i realize they got great reviews but i thought they would be a bit thicker. they just feel too flimsy and too much like i'm ready for bed. i was looking for more lounge pants that i felt like if i needed to run up to the store on a saturday afternoon that i wasn't wearing pjs. i just can't get past that. they are totally cute but i was definitely looking for more summer lounge-wear.    i ordered the small which fit fine. i wear 4-6 in retailer pants. i got the p
1,The design on this dress is so cute. it runs really small. i had to go up from my normal size 4 to a 6. i am not well endowed so the top was great on me. it's looks great on once k got a size that works.
1,This top is amazing. so soft and the off the shoulder part stays where it belongs. i'm usually a large but got this in a med. fits perfectly.
