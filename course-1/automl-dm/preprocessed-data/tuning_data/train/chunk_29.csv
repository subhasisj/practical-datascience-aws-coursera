0,I ordered a large and it was skin tight  if that's the look you're going for..
0,This is an adorable piece but the fit is a gamble. the crotch hung way too low for comfort on these so since i got a great sale price  i had them altered. i haven't worn them yet but i'm sure i'll get compliments when i do. so if you want to take chance on the fit and/or alter them  go for it!
1,"Loved this dress. fit like a glove  so flattering  and perfect for a summer/fall wedding. material is substantial and dress is well made. i'm 5'4  large chest  and curvy  and a size 6 fit perfectly. longer than seen on the model for me  but i actually love it being tea-length.     a strip of tulle attached to the lining underneath the skirt to help it ""poof."" i removed it  but looks good either way."
-1,I have had this shirt for a little over a month. i've wore it maybe 3-5 times and there is a small hole in the middle of the sleeve on my shoulder. it's not even on a seam  so i can't fix it. i expect much better quality from retailer. don't buy this. the quality is very disappointing. which is really unfortunate because this is a very nice fitting shirt and goes well with pencil skirts.
1,Cute top  i actually got a lot of compliments on it.  the white is slightly see through  which doesn't bother me but could bother other people. all around cute casual piece.
-1,I love the idea of this shirt  but the execution is absolutely horrible. i ordered online and what i received is just a mess. the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread. not just a few hanging off  but literally big clumps. a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside!! the fit is just as big a mess. i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br
0,The colors and print are absolutely beautiful and i'm quite heartbroken that this suit just doesn't fit. i don't have a long torso but the v was just so plunging that i wouldn't feel comfortable leaving the backyard lounge chair in this bathing suit. no matter how much i tied the halter it still revealed a v halfway down to my naval. the strange thing is that there seemed to be too much fabric on top  lots of ruching and thicker straps than i would normally go for  and while i'm only around a b
1,Great very flattering bohemian dress! and it's silk!
0,I ordered this in the pink color. the fit was fine  but i didn't care for how thin it was. there is lining  which i suppose is there to combat the thinness  but it's only in certain places. the lining should have been all over. maybe if i had gotten this in blue  it wouldn't have been so bad.
0,I wanted to give this a glowing review but i ended up returning this cardigen. the folds on top added too much to my frame. i do not suggest this for heavier apple shapes. for all others  it is incredibly soft and warm. the tan color was weird but they others are simply gorgeous.
-1,This sweater was pretty short. beyond that  when i raised my arms  the thickness of the sweater caused the shoulders to rise up and stay there when i put my arms down.
-1,Another tent-like tee. this shirt is thin but not in a bad way and the color and design are really nice. but...it is really boxy and i'm just tired of that look. the longer sleeves are a plus for fall.
-1,These jeans were so cute on- wore them a handful of times and they'd been washed twice. put them on and - rip! ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable- and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear. poor quality - disappointing and not what i expected from retailer. :-( they also run large even for a more relaxed fit- sized down for a good fit.
-1,I ordered a small and the top part was huge yet the bottom a little snug. you need a big chest and small legs and bottom. too bad. it's very cute.
-1,The minute i put this sweater on  i couldn't wait to take it off. it was way too scratchy for me. so  for those with any type of sensitivity to wool  this is not the sweater for you. otherwise  i thought the design was quite cute.
0,"First of all i need to state that i am 5 1"". i usually get the petite size small but they were out so i took a risk and ordered the regular small which i can sometimes get away with. upon opening the parcel  it seemed bigger than i expected. the knit is very chunky (not a bad thing) but thicker than i expected. the fit was way too large for me. the shoulders were bulky and because it is a cocoon shaped cardigan  there was just too much excess fabric draping around my petite frame. i think if i c"
1,I love this top. it's not just an average tee due to the asymmetry in the seams. it's super soft and comes in some great colors. i wish it was slightly longer on the sides but otherwise perfect tee!
0,"I have to confess i had very high hopes for this dress. i was buying it as a stylish  modern alternative to a business suit. i wanted this dress to work as a piece to deliver presentations in or attend faculty functions. tailored  conservative  and edgy at the same time. several hundred dollars dress should meet the aforementioned needs  i thought. but it did not. the best description for the dress is ""blah""  average.  the material is textures and crinkly  not slick. the top is cream/ivory color"
-1,I tried this blouse on in the store. i'm generally an 8 or 10 in this brand. i got down to a size 4 and gave up. this blouse is huge all the way around. the detail on the blouse is pretty  but the tent like cut made it impossible for me to buy it. i know retailers blouses can be swingy and flows but this went way beyond. perhaps on a tall person the swing would work but on a short person like myself...i looked ridiculous.
-1,It looks like you are wearing cargo shorts. really unflattering. avoid buying this skirt
0,I am torn about this dress. the print is very pretty and the fabric has a gentle flow to it. the top part is great but the portion below the chest reminded me of a tent. it is tricky to pull off if you are well-endowed on the top or wear a padded bra. i liked the look better when i tied it at the back with the ultra-thin belt straps which gave some shape to the waist. i agree with the other reviewer that a slim person could carry the look well. i usually don't return online purchases unless they
-1,I loved this top online and even more when i opened it up. however  the quality of the stitching is poor. where the seam comes together at the hip on both sides  the stitching is very loose and appears to be coming undone. i was bummed and am sending it back today.
-1,I didn't realize that the grey sleeves are attached (i assumed that was just an undershirt on the model). needless to say it looks cheap and poorly made. will be returning
1,I love this t-shirt  i wish it came in tons of other prints! very soft  almost feels lived in  and high quality all the same.
0,It broke my heart to return this shirt. the pattern is just the kind of quirky that i crave from retailer. the quality is really great but in the end this shirt was just way to big. i don't think the xs would have made enough of a difference. sad face.
1,Count me in as a five star lover of this dress! the details are so rich and interesting  so be prepared to get noticed when wearing. i'm happy to say that getting the size medium regular (instead of petite) was a good choice for my top heavy frame. the chest is fitted but not tight  the length is a not-too-short above knee  the tiered layers swing so nicely  and the beads/sequins add a touch is whimsy to the design. my one negative is the tassels at the neck tie--soo heavy cumbersome to style. o
1,I was looking for a dress for my engagement pictures and once i saw this dress i knew it was the one! i ordered the white in a small (size 2) i am 5'4 130lbs. it fits perfect and the length is just right. some reviews said it's boxy and has too much flow to it but if you have the right size it won't be an issue! yes  it's a lace dress so it's going to be delicate and you'll need to handle with care. but it's worth it  absolutely stunning!
1,These are some of the few pants that are semi loose with a wide waist band that make me look thinner! i love them. they are soft! they match everything. they make an outfit effortlessly chic. i took a size m and it fit tts.
-1,Sctrachy  short  boxy  stiff.  loved the idea of this sweater  but this was not what i was hoping for
1,Love this dress so beautiful embroidery is lovely....well worth the price!!!
0,"I'm usually a small (5'5""  116 lbs  long torso)  but the x-small fit well. the black does look see-through in the pictures  but i figured i could wear a cami with it. it is see-through in person if you are up close  mainly in the back and arms since the front has extra fabric in places. however  it is rather short  possibly because it is an x-small  and i'll need a short cami to fit under it or will have to have a cami hanging out of the bottom  which drapes nicely and a cami may mar that effect"
-1,But  it just doesn't measure up. first  the slip/lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on - either stepping into it or pulling it over your head. and  once on  the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky. unfortunately  i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately. the material is really cute  but the dress isn't worth the price / effort.
0,"Loved the look of this wool and so well made! problem was it literally would have been better on a bed as a blanket than on my body as a blanket coat. just overwhelmed me and didn't look good. i'm 5/9"" and 160 lbs so i'm no shrinking violet just too heavy of fabric."
0,I really wanted this to work. the embroidery detail is very pretty. however  the inside of the sweatshirt is a bit scratchy from the embroidery so i would recommend wearing a cami or tank. the sweatshirt is also on the short size. the small hit the top of my jean waist. in the end  i decided to return it:(
1,"First  i noticed that the ""grey"" was more like a blue-grey/navy which i don't mind because it's still a nice  unique color.  i ordered petite size 26 and although these are very well made/sturdy cords and fit at the ankle like the model pictured  the thigh/calves were surprisingly a bit too tight for me (and my calves are s c r a w n y).  this cord version doesn't seem as stretchy as some of their other styles so  i'm going back for the standard 26's!"
0,"So bummed... i ordered this in the raspberry color then actually saw it in a store before it arrived to my house  so i tried it on. while i agree with the other reviews  it runs big in some areas  something about the neckline just wasn't right on me. it seemed to ride up higher and wasn't what i wanted. also  the ""raspberry"" color is almost more of a burnt orange. when i think of raspberry  i think of pink or red  this was neither of those. the top itself is cute though and super comfy. if it we"
-1,This is a nice shirt  but i can't keep it. i ordered a 0 and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am (usually wear 00 petite in all pants) and i think this size was perfect (fit across the back perfectly) when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach. at the same time  the high low styling makes for a really strange shirt-tail in the back. i'm sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute
0,I ordered this in the mauve and it's a really pretty lilac color. unfortunately  the fabric is very thin and you can see your bra right through it. my usual size fit great in the shoulders and bust area  but goes downhill from there. the top is cut wide under the armpits and just hangs funny in front. based on the model picture  i thought this would be a little more form fitting in the front. it's also very long. completely covers my butt in the back and then some. could of been a beautiful tank
-1,This is the 2nd time i've purchased a dolan top and returned it b/c it was dry clean only. both tops were what i consider to be casual tops to be worn with a pair of jeans  running errands  etc. i do not dry clean this kind of casual shirt. it is made out of rayon  and that's the problem i think.  i purchased this in the wine color and it is a lovely color  hangs nicely  doesn't cling. the sleeves are a bit long but i could live with that -- i just pushed them up. as a turtleneck  it was a bit l
0,"I was so excited to try out this top since it was such a bargain and neutral. unfortunately  the shape is ""a"" line and accentuates the hip area a bit more than i find flattering. so  it will be returned."
1,Surprisingly  this poncho is both flattering and soft. i must say i didn't think the fabric would be as soft  since a lot of knits have wool  but this is great.  i purchased both xs/s and xs/s p.  the petite was just slightly more fitted  so i went with that. i love the boat neck  on me  it gives the poncho an elegant look. colors are nice and neutral.i  think i will wear this with dresses and jeans  both. great purchase. (115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist)
0,"As previously mentioned  this dress runs very large. i ordered accordingly  and the small was the right size for my frame  but it was just not flattering. i'm pear shaped  and i found the shoulders to be large  the neck a bit too high  and the overall cut to hug my figure in a very unflattering way. i'm 5'4""  140-ish  and maybe if i were a few pounds lighter and a few inches taller  it could've worked. i so wanted to love this  because it's soft and comfortable and cute  but back it goes."
0,"So sad!  this beautiful dress which i have been waiting to receive didn't work for me.  i'm a 5'7"" hourglass girl and it just made me look big!  but i love the pattern and the way it looks on the photo online!  so sad but will return it!0"
-1,I ordered these leggings and loved them  for about an hour- at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant  leaving a hole. i called customer service and they sent me a 2nd pair. same thing happened. i never even pulled on the belt loop. they are just so flimsy. it's a shame bc they are cool looking.
0,"I like this top  but it does not fit me correctly. i am 5'1""  and have a larger bust  34 c. this shirt fits in the length  but is tight in the bust. i would have to buy this in a medium. i normally wear an xs or s. the quality is better than most t shirts  and i ordered the red. the red is a deep and striking color  and one of the better reds i've seen this season. the biggest problem i had was the cut of the shirt. the top cuts in and doesn't provide coverage  my bras are not covered by this to"
1,These are super cute and i love the ties on the legs. fit is true to size. i bought them on sale and they had some black marks on the front when received. i called retailer and their great customer service guaranteed that i could return them if the black did not come out when washed. it did  so i'm stoked.
1,These pants have a very odd design but they are so soft and so comfortable i could not resist. going on a trip to key west and thought they would be great for the plane ride. they fit true to size. could not pass up as they were on sale.
1,I just bought these in store. so great looking. however  i bought the petites and they are still incredibly long. like 6 inches too long. so  i'll hem them  though based on the review that mentions shrinking  i might wash them first to see what happens. great for summer in the city.
1,I wasn't sure about this dress because some of retailer's cloths can make a women appear older before her time. i have to say that is not the case with this dress. i ordered it with the green and mint patterns in my normal size 2. this dress could not have been more beautiful on. i'm 5'6 115lbs and it fit perfect. the colors really compliment my dark hair and fair skin. i won't even need sunless tanner. i highly recommend this dress and placed the designer on my list to try out again.
-1,The skiers  cats  and puffin patterns are adorable and i was very tempted to keep the shirts just for the patterns. unfortunately  the fit was awful. i am short and need to highlight my waist and this shirt did the opposite. the skier fabric is also see-through. the tenting issue could be fixed if you belt the shirt or tuck it in  but it is not very long. 100% rayon fabric is a bummer too. the shirt was snug at the bicep  but not as bad as i expected from the reviews. i sized up from an 8 to 10.
0,This shirt is really cute but a little stiff. it does come with a slip  but the slip was tight  but the shirt fit  maybe even a little big. i used another cami under which was better. i think think the sizing is off in terms of slip vs. the actual shirt. i got it in the store with the 30% off  so it was a good deal. it does stretch out as you wear it  so it will get bigger and it did make me look a little bigger  but still cute on and for a summer shirt  it's thin  so it does work well in that r
-1,I usually wear a size medium in angel of the north but this was very small. i would need to have ordered a size large or xl to have it fit. pretty but returning.
1,Looks great with jeans for a more bohemian look.  i normally wear a medium but went large to accommodate a 6 month pregnant belly.  the blouse is loose enough i probably could have stayed with the medium.
1,Was hoping i was going to love this top and i did. its a fun piece to dress up or down.
0,I loved the style and shape of the dress . it does run small. i had to return it because some of the black dots pulled and looked like it might be more of a problem as i wore it
-1,This dress hangs horribly. unlike the photo  the waist does not cinch. too bad. the colors are great and the quality of the material is nice. because i bought it on sale  i may try to tailor it to work  but unless you are willing to do that  its a no go. :-(
0,I also wanted to love this top but sadly had to return it because it is very short and the peplum piece is very wide. it was not flattering at all.
0,I was excited to receive in hopes to wear more as a tunic over skinnies vs a dress for fall. this runs sooo very large. the material is thick  and the pattern is just ok. didn't do anything for my hourglass shape. returned.
-1,The top i received was large  really long in length  pockets in the front along the seam  and lots of volume in the back without any princess seams to give it shape. the id #'s matched  but that's about it. returned!
-1,This dress is absolutely hideous on my physique. ordered a size 6 and it hung on me like a cheaply made tent. i have an athletic built am a 34d. it is going back asap.
-1,Does not look like the picture. lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up. i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs.
1,"The colors on these leggings are just beautiful!  the material is very soft and has a nice thickness to it.  no issues with see thru material.  i am 5'8""  145  and i ordered my usual medium."
1,Picked this up at the local retailer in both colors. the red version was styled in the store with the adorable blue snail cardigan - which i also bought. highly recommend.
0,These culottes run very large--more than 2 inches of gaping waist band in my usual size. i would have kept them if they had fit  although sitting in them on a hot day might cause major wrinkling
1,It is a pretty dress but runs large  i usually wear small and i ordered a regular xs because they are out of petite... it fits and since i am pregnant it works but it is a little large around the waist...  the lace is beautiful and the quality is amazing
-1,Long-time ag jeans fan. lately though  i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans  i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the prima jeans i ordered (same review there).  so back both pairs went.   it's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material.
-1,So disappointed in the abundance of polyester fabrics that retailer carries these days. especially at this price point. the pattern and style of this dress is beautiful  but i will never spend two hundred dollars (or even half that) on a poly dress. please add more linen  cotton  and silk!
1,I wasn't sure how the knotted front would look on me  but it lays perfectly. very comfortable  well-designed  flattering top in lovely rich colors. i'm normally a small-medium in retailer tops  but i got the large as it does run small and i don't like things too clingy. so best to try on in store rather than buy online. nice simple statement piece!
1,This was a very nice sweater but i had to return because it came too late for a birthday gift i was giving. it also was not the sweater i had originally thought i had ordered. my mistake. it was very soft and would be suitable for any type of figure.
1,I purchased this adorable dress to wear on vacation. it's such a cute fun print. i purchased my regular size xs and it's a good fit. the material is a little stiff but the print makes up for it. got it during the 25 percent promo ..
