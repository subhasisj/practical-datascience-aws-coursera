1,"The attention to detail in aligning the pattern is excellent as always with this brand.  .  i tried a size 2 and it fit fine  just above my long waist ( 5'2""  currently 33-25-37.5 with narrow hips and fuller thighs). i have several other cartonnier shorts in sizes 0 and 2  depending on my weight  and these fit similarly. i think the size 2 petite would be a bit lower but it's sold out now.  .  the only reason i passed was that the fabric has a polyester fusible interfacing so that it keeps its s"
1,I saw this dress online and b-lined it to the store to try on. it is a beautifully made dress. lots of great detail with stitching and beading on the front placket. feels very boho and chic. i have received lots of compliments while wearing this dress. i was almost turned off by the price  but decided to see it in person. worth every penny. wear it with sandals or tall boots  could have worn a medium  but a little tight for 38c on top.
1,"This skirt is not only cute but really comfy. i really like the materials it's made of and the way it seems to hug my body in a flattering way. i'm 5'2"" so the only down side is that i wish it came in petite but i still kept it because it looked great hitting me right above my knees and high at my waist. love this skirt!"
-1,I loved them on when i got them  but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them  and i had them on no more than 5 times. it was not a fit issue or a seam issue; they literally just frayed apart in two areas.  while flattering and incredibly comfortable  the fabric was not at all durable...they are not your typical  denim   they almost kind of a knit feel them.
-1,There were no reviews when i purchased this dress. from the picture with the model  the dress looks to be a straight shift dress. i received mine yesterday and the dress flairs out and isn't straight. it is also pretty large. i ordered a medium as the smalls were sold out and i'm not sure i will keep it. still on the fence. dress is shorter than pictured as well. sleeves are shorter than shown. now  after having seen the dress and looking at the online picture  i think the model is holding her a
-1,Such a pretty fall sweater. nice fit. wore it once out shopping and it snagged :( had to return  sadly.
1,This dress is everything. i'm 5'4  athletic build  36d and the medium fit me perfectly. the colors are really understated and beautiful and can easily be dressed up or down. i wish the elastic around the waist fell a little lower but that's one of those things only i notice and definitely didn't keep me from falling in love and buying it. can't wait to wear it on vacation next week!
0,This dress is stunning  no doubt - a shimmering forest green under a black teardrop motif  thick material  nicely cut  with pocket panels that are forgiving to a belly. however  the fact that this dress has zero stretch (which is fine  if that's what you're looking for)  coupled with what is quite possibly the cheapest zipper ever manufactured  make this dress exhausting to put on. i'm normally a 14/16 at retailer  and i ordered the 16 just to be safe  and the waist is exactly the size of my waist
1,Purchased this dress at the sale price  with an additional 20% off sale  not exactly sure what to expect-- the print is so different than my usual style preference. so glad i did! while the dress is way oversized (for reference  i'm 5'4  132 lbs) ordered size sm but prob should have gone with xs) it's stylish  yet effortless. today is the first day of wear (at my office) and already received many complements.
0,"I just received this dress in the mail today. i ordered an xs and it was huge! there is no way that i could wear a bra without it showing due to the size of the arm holes. i'm 5'2"" and 117 lbs with an athletic build for reference. i love free flowing dresses  but this was over the top. i ordered the plaid version in an xs petite and that fit much truer to size. i reordered this in an xs petite to see if that will work better. the dress itself is lovely. the green color is vibrant and the embroid"
1,Very comfortable and cute. i had fallen in love with this in the catalog and when i saw it in the store  i was disappointed. however  after trying it on  i had to have it. very flattering and comfortable.
1,These shorts are very well made and the embroidery work is beautiful. the dark yellow is a little bit more orangy looking than in the pictures  but is still a pretty color. don't expect any give or stretch with these shorts.
0,This dress is very cute and fits quite well. you don't have to wear a bra with it  which is awesome  and it has delightful pockets. the downside is that the fabric on the top half is a little weird. it is very heavy and stiff. also  the inside has some fraying and the quality does not seem to be the best. i'm keeping it though.
1,I wanted to comment about the wash. yes  these jeans look really ?dirty? when you  pull them out of the package. but after a few months of washing  the dirty color has really  mellowed. also  i am a usual 26 in jeans  purchased these in 25 and could have fit into   the 24. i may purchase another pair  these jeans are really unique  comfortable  great   for the summer with sandals or converse.
0,I recommend with reservations. these leggings are 100% wool  soft  not itchy  light weight  lovely knitted pattern. they run large. i sized down to a small. the first time i wore them they were fine. but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless: they were falling down as i walked. such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days. they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter. so what to do? at the price th
-1,"I'm 5""0"" and weigh 105 lbs. i purchased the xxs and it was super-wide  and big all over. it looked like a pregnancy top and did not lay as nicely as shown on the model. also  not shown on the model is the front is short and the back is very long. this would work better on a taller person. i just find it odd that a xxs is still too big. the quality of the fabric and the print is good and the lace-up in the back is cute."
-1,"I couldn't wait to get this dress! i bought it and was instantly disappointed when i took it out of the bag. while the fabric was beautiful  the sizing was way off. this dress claims to be 35"" long  and i could tell instantly it wasn't. it barely covered my rear. i also know it's supposed to be flowy  but it was really  really wide. i can see this working for someone around 5 feet tall who is wider."
-1,I ordered this and thought it would be cute for work  but it tuns out the sleeves are ridiculously long. i am 5 foot 10 and do not have short arms. also it is a bit short waisted for me. i do love the floral detail of the button.
-1,I had been eyeing this coat for a few weeks after it appeared in the email  and i finally decided to purchase it to treat myself. i was very excited to get it  as it is a beautiful coat online. however  once i received it i was very disappointed. the material is much thinner than i would expect for something that cost $168  and when i went to button it the button slipped right off the thread it was sewn onto the coat with. i checked the other buttons and all of them were loose as well.     perso
-1,The design and quality were great. i really wanted them to fit but they ran large. i'm 5'4 and 120 lbs and orderd the small. unfortunately the fit seemed off as well and i won't be trying a size down. the waist and hips were huge but the thigh area was fitted enough that a smaller size would have been awkward. sadly these went back.
1,This skirt is a must have!! it is very classy  and the pockets are perfect for holding lipstick for a little refresher throughout the night. it is high quality and definitely worth the price. i paired this skirt with a more casual black top and some pearls for a fancy banquet dinner  and got a lot of compliments. comfortable and classy.
-1,This dress hit my waist in a weird spot and was too short. i would not have felt comfortable bending over. it was a tad too full which wasn't flattering either.  i really wanted to love it bc they design is adorable.  i need to return it!!
-1,I have been dying to try a mara hoffman bathing suit  so i went for this one. unfortunately  the design of the bathing suit is not like what they sent me. the middle where the tops meets the bottom  is squared off  not like that v that it looks like in this photo. it also makes for major side boob/sagging on each side. i was very disappointed.
1,I ordered this online  but i own the vest and i love it  so i took a chance. this is a super comfy  great quality jacket. the sleeves are some kind of knit material and that makes it really cozy and not constrictive. the color  i ordered the green  is perfect. i ultimately returned the jacket because i thought the lapels were just too wide for my liking. they look exactly like the picture so if you don't mind that  you will probably be very happy with this jacket. it just wasn't for me. i ended
0,This top is very cute  but i found it runs small in the bust  which is unusual for maeve. i will have to return it. you may want to size up  if you have a generous bust.
0,This was my favorite item in the august catalog & i knew i had to have it. my store had not received it yet so i ordered online. after reading the other reviews  i sized down and the fit is still much too large as this top has way too much material. this is coming from someone who loves swing tees and can appreciate a loose fit. however  this top hangs like a tent. also  the elastic around the bottom of the sleeves is quite uncomfortable. i do think the top is pretty and recommend only if you ar
-1,I had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy. im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest. not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver. wouldn't recommend it.
-1,Beautiful print  however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer  much sheerer than the product shot shows. i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami  however my nude bra was completely visible.  the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans  so much shorter than the tunic length shown  and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person (the top half of the sleeves are slim  and the bottom half are looser).  over
-1,If you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest  this is the one for you. i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition  but this one did not do it for me. i cannot imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone  and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy.
1,Gorgeous colors  high quality. my only word of caution is that the top part is very tight. if you have a large chest (c+) this is going to be snug  or not fit at all. i'm wearing it now in pregnancy  but i think it will also look great post-partum. can be dressed up or down.
0,I love the cold shoulder trend  and this top seemed to satisfy. i bought it in the blue  which is really more like a very light mint green. however  i think the material is pretty thin (though soft)  and the keyhole sleeve area  right by the twist  is not substantial so it looks a little cheap. i ordered the small  but i think i could have definitely sized down to the xs (110 pounds  32dd). it's very loose fitting but i wouldn't say it looks bad. it's just a very relaxed fit. for the price  thou
0,Overall nice material and styling but be prepare for it to be huge. i purposely sized down and i still felt like i was swimming in this.
-1,I love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it. i was shocked when i opened the package. first  the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting. it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton. it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono  which brings me to the second disappointment. it is not a kimono at all. it has no kimono sleeve  no sleeves at all in fact. just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu
1,This is a fun dress to have in your closet! i ordered the 4p  and it was just a little to short for my taste. had the regular 4 sent  and it was perfect! i wore it the very next night to a party... feels great and lots of fun with the bel sleeves!
0,I am totally on the fence with this shirt. like the other reviewers  i sized up because my normal 14 was too tight in the chest (a common problem for me). the arms are strangely tight and i didn't get much more room in the bust with the 16. but then the bottom of the shirt tents away and hangs funny. this is obviously meant for those with a very small bust who are on the slender side. i love the pattern and material though  so i'm going to visit my trusty seamstress and see if she can place dart
1,The material and design of this beach dress is so pretty. i was hoping that this could be worn as both a dress and a swim suit cover-up  but it is only the latter. you can't see it from the photos (the model or mine)  but it is very sheer.... it can really only be worn over a swimsuit. whatever you wear (or don't) will be completely visible. so if you are looking for just a lovely  unique beach dress  this is it! unfortunately for the price i need more versatility! i will consider it on sale!
0,Bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost. fabric feels cheap  like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly. did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack. gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag. returned it.
-1,I have purchased a lot from retailer but lately  some of the items have been disappointing in quality.verses cost  this being one. the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this. the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves.
0,"I am 5'4""  100lbs  petite frame  i bought this dress in xxsp. the fabric was good quality and thicker than i have imagined  good for fall  maybe a little warm for the hot humid summer days  but perhaps a cooler summer day. unfortunately this dress runs pretty large  much too large for my petite frame  so i had to return it. i would recommend sizing down. this dress is very beautiful and would be great to wear to work or out for after work drinks  also maybe a bridal shower or other brunch event."
1,I have worn this dress twice and it is amazing. the material feels heavy and drapey but i still feel nice and cool in it. i always have several people asking me where i bought it when i wear it. i am 5'1 130 lbs and 34 d. i bought a small petite and it fit perfectly. i love this dress and would highly recommend it to anyone. definitely one of the best things i've ever bought from retailer.
1,I tried this tunic at a store and loved it. i had to buy a much bigger size because the sleeves are so narrow.  the 12 fit ok but the sleeves are so tight it hurt. i have normal arms and i am so glad i was at a store to try a bigger size.
0,I loved the look of this top the moment i saw it in the store  particularly the muted red color. the crochet detail is very pretty and i found the fit to be quite flattering on me. however  part of the crochet detail on the one i received has a hole that needs to be repaired. since i purchased during the sale  i'm going to try and mend myself  but this may end up having to go back. if you see this in store and find one that is not damaged  i would recommend it!
-1,Usually an retailer dress in a large fits me perfectly however not this one. i am larger busted and this dress was way too tight on top. possibly better on smaller chests. the dress is cute and the rest of the fit was good. not for me could barely pull it down over the boobs. going back :(
-1,So disappointed! beautiful dress in the photographs but the cut was incredibly strange. loose and baggy through the top and mid-section but tight around the buttock and thighs.
0,As you can see  there is an array of differing opinions on here  and i share sentiments on both:  _______  pros:  - the texture and feel of this is great; it is very comfortable and is different.  - tts for the most part; i normally can wear sizes 10 and 12 (m and l) with most retailer and got the medium and the fit was overall fine but more snug at the hips. if you're more slim/straight  it'll probably fit you like on the model.   - good length  not too short or too long.  - the mock collar is ni
1,Love this skirt! i did have to get one size larger than usual but the length was perfect on me and i love the color (i got the slate).can be dressed up or down.
1,I'm a big fan of left of center as a brand  and this top is definitely a winner!  the deep green is gorgeous and looks fantastic with denim. the shirt is true to size and is flatteringly loose without looking too tent-like. highly recommend!
1,"I like this dress because it has a 60's vibe. however  if this swing style is too long  it just looks dowdy. this dress was too long  so i shortened and redeemed mine. i am 5'3 1/2"" and 120 lbs. this style looks best on me just above the kneecap. if you try it on and hate it  it's probably because it's too long. in the winter i wear this with a long sweater (knee length) with a waistband in it to give it shape and with boots. the dress is lined but it is very  very sheer and requires a slip. or "
0,This top is very sweet and looks lovely on the model. it was not flattering for my larger bust  with the inverted pleat opening at my bustline and spreading out over my waist. the quality is nice  the fit in the shoulders is snug. the length is a bit short for me  but it may lay better on a different body type.
-1,I liked the design and i didn't mind that is see through  but i couldn't put it on ! not size 8 what is my usual size   not size 10 or 12  even 14! my shoulders wouldn't go through the middle part and it is not stretchy   so disappointed. i really wanted to like it.
0,I fell in love instantly...but...upon looking in the mirror  it is 100 percent see through. at least the black is... i love it enough that i am going to try to put a cami underneath. however  that mayn't work. the shirt is lovely in and of itself  but at 48  i don't need a see through shirt. it is also defiantly about a size larger that expected. so size down. almost so good!
-1,As another reviewer pointed out  although the tag inside the dress says that you can machine wash in cold water  the color around the popsicles will bleed! this is extremely disappointing. i'm hoping it can either be fixed with dye remover  or that retailer will take this item back. would only dry clean this item.
0,This is really cute online  but is not fantastic on or in person. this is a top that i may be returning. i love the open shoulder  but the material is very thin  and the top runs large. it also hangs really low in the back which i am not a huge fan of.
0,I first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater: the stitch is pretty  but the fabric isn't nearly as soft as i expected. it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater. that said  the fit is pretty flattering. i didn't have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model. i've been looking for this style of sweater  so i'll probably keep it. however  it really didn't meet my expectations for quality.
0,I loved this top when i wore it! it draped beautifully. i always snatch up all of bordeaux t-shirts because of the way they hang. but beware - you must dry this flat. i've always had no problem washing and drying their t-shirts  but this one shrunk up to half it's size the first time i washed it and is no longer wearable. it does say on tag lay flat to dry and they mean it!
1,"This is a great blouse. the fabric is a fine rayon which is soft and has a lovely drape to it. i have found rayon to be a good fabric all year and quite cool in the summer. i am 5'7"" long waisted and 127 lbs with a slender build so i usually wear a size 6--this fits perfectly as well as being quite flattering. it can be worn loose or belted with a contrasting or black belt over skinny jeans. it would also be swell with a pencil skirt. it will cover any fashion flaws! i usually like to shop the s"
1,These jeans are well-made  the cut is decently flattering  but on more muscular thighs  it would look nicer if the cuff was a bit higher. the petite on me was just below the ankle  so it just looks like i folded my jeans because they were too long. if you are taller or have longer legs (mine are short on my short height)  then i think these would be great. i dind't find them particularly small  but htey were snug (muscular thighs). overall  ok but returning them. (25 p ordered  115 lbs  26.5 in
-1,I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8  went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type  but compared to the model  this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.
0,The way the back came down so much made the top look weird. i do like some tops that hang longer in the back but this one was just too much. also the material was kind of blah it was thick polyester which would not be very cool during the summer and the color looked better in the picture. so to me it was just a over priced odd top.
-1,"I loved this dress when i saw it. however the fit was way off. i am 5'7"" 120 lbs and the small was way too big from the waist down. when the xs arrived i was sure it would be perfect. unfortunately the waist hit way too high  above my rib cage and the dress was too short. it was as if it was a petite size. i was very disappointed as this is such a pretty  easy dress to just throw on for school. unfortunately neither size looked right on me and i had to return both. the material is also not the s"
1,"The perfect pair. i am 5'6"". 130lb  and ordered size 28  and it fits just right. it is a little stretchy  so molds to your shape. the legs are slender  but not too fitted. no stitching along the seems makes these jeans classy enough to work with a dressy shirt."
0,"I think i received a mislabeled vest?? when i opened the package  i thought it was some sort of joke!  i was expecting what the stock photos show  a longer length flowy sweater vest.... mine was literally child sized. i'm not a big person at all.. i'm 5'6""  135 lbs  and wear a 6/8. i ordered this in a m/l  thinking i would like it loose. i tried it on thinking  maybe it will look longer once on.. no.. not even. i looked ridiculous. the front hit above the waist of my jeans and the back hit middl"
1,Bought this for my daughter in college for her birthday. i heard shouts of this being her new go-to top.  her roomies have already tried to borrow it. super comfy with a beautiful off-the-shoulder style.  no one can go wrong with this!
1,The pictures of this sweater do not do it justice. i would have passed it over online but it immediately caught my eye in the store. the yarn is soft and cozy and the flair at the bottom adds a feminine touch. zipper is cute. v-neck is just right - it is not too low. i know i will be wearing this sweater a lot - very happy with this purchase! i didn't see the pink or navy in the store.
0,I liked this top  i really did. i also liked the subtle shimmer. the fabric didn't seem as soft  but i could not get over the big difference in length between the front and the back. you can see it on the model here  but when i tried it on it was even more obvious and just didn't look right. asymmetrical tops look better when the length difference is not so large  but here it is. the print at the top also made my shoulders look a little broader. i am sending it back.
-1,I thought it would be heavier than it is. it's thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater (it contains wool so not really suitable for spring/summer). it's also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider/boxier too.
1,So cozy and warm  great for the cold nights!
0,First  i was surprised that this skirt fabric felt similar to men's tie.  it is a thick weight silky feel.  next  i was surprised by the cut.... i wear a 12/14 petite  and the waist of the large is at least a size 10 if not smaller.  finally  the length was really long.  i realize i am 5'2 and buying non-petite sizes  but the cut was high ankle on me. i like the pattern and ruffles of fabric  both are unusual and good for fall/winter.  but i did not like the rest.
0,I'm not sure i recommend this shirt but i did purchase the plum yesterday. i'm always always a m and had to size down to an xs on this one. that's how large it was! even the xs had plenty of room; i'm 5'6 145 lbs 36b for reference. the material look like it will stretch out even further but i got it anyway. it was on sale plus 25% off and for that price i can use it for casual days on the weekends. it's comfortable on and loved the lace detail.
-1,As soon as you get up close to this sweater  you will notice that the bird on the front is of an interesting kind of material-almost like carpet that has been shaved waaaaaaaay down so that the little fibers are sticking straight up and a fraction of a millimeter high. i was not excited about this texture and can imagine it will be a huge magnet for collecting lint and dust throughout the day. the fit was way off on this one for me and was not flattering at all. it wasn't for me at all even thou
-1,I really wanted to love this blazer...i've even tried it on several times hoping it would look better the next time around. (spoiler: it didn't :( ). overall  it makes me look pretty frumpy and not put together. i really love saturday/sunday brand and was hoping for a nice comfy blazer to wear to work. will be returning instead.
