0,I loved this but couldn't believe how small it was.
-1,This cardigan is made of nice materials and is lined  but it is boxy and totally un-fitted. i swim  which means i have large shoulders  and this thing makes me look like a boxing champion  well a fat boxing champion as it has not waste-line. the sleeves are too long  and as usual  retailer saves on money by using little cheap hooks instead of buttons as a closing system  so if you choose to close this cardigan  it just looks awful.
-1,Doesn't feel like cotton jersey. feels like a thin version of the seamless cami. it's not soft as i expected. it's much thinner than expected too.
-1,This dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah. i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same. not cute  not flattering  the model photo is deceiving. would not recommend  although it looks airy and comfy.
-1,This whole order was disappointing. the main piece i ordered was cancelled and the two remaining items - this sweater included were poorly made. there was a snag/thread hanging out in the middle of the front of the sweater - tried to tuck it in but it wouldn't stay so i'll be returning it.
0,I stalked this blouse and when the price dropped  i pounced on the black. sadly  it did nothing for me. i'm a large  sometimes medium  but decided on the large. you'd think it came with its own cami at this price  but no. completely sheer. unwearable without one. the lace is nothing special. the collar is wider in the back  uncomfortable and pulls on the lace in the front. the high/low hem fit me oddly in the back. i'm returning this one.
1,Very comfortable and attractive pullover. not too long or bulky  although i find myself rolling the sleeves up to keep them out of the way!  but it's a keeper
-1,"The model looks awesome in this cute top  but on me it looked boxy but was too tight around the chest and was too short (for reference  i'm 5'7 "" 140 lbs.  and 34c). the front is non-stretchy eyelet lace cotton fabric  yet the back is stretchy. in theory  it's pretty  but in reality it doesn't work - at least for me. i think it might work for someone petite with a smaller chest."
0,I didn't really notice the collar when i ordered it on line and i'm not really liking it. it's the rough  unstitched thing they like to do sometimes and it just makes it look slightly more casual and well  rough around the edges. it's a nicely cut  great fitting sweater though so i'll be looking for some scarves!
-1,I am 5 '5 and 119 pounds with an athletic cury body type. the dress wore bulky and ran large at size 2.
-1,In a word .. clingy ... and not in good way. long so you need it to flow not cling. liked the back  but front was just too clingy. back it goes.
-1,"The shirt is absolutely cute looking. but that's just that....looks. i'm 5'2"" size 6 & wears m to l top. i tried on the medium in the store  it was rather flowing. i liked it. but i didn't like how it fit on the underarm area. it hung very low. so i ordered a petite m. still the same. plus the store the lighting was dark so i didn't realize how see through the shirt was too. had to return it."
1,I ordered this top (black) in both small and medium; i can get usually away with small at retailer but am size medium in all other stores. as soon as i received the package and opened it up  i knew i would keep this top. it has a gorgeous texture to it  a slight sheen  and is well made. it's extremely comfortable as a t-shirt would be  but has more structure and looks very chic. the waist nips in just enough to give the flutter hem a little flare at the hips and is very feminine. i have a long tor
1,First of all  this jean fits really well  but i usually wear a 31 in mother jeans and i had to go up to a 32 in these (ugh!) because they just ran smaller or whatever. i am curvy on the bottom but the 31's just felt too tight and pulled everywhere.  second  the color is not quite right in this picture; it looks more military green. it is not - it is a much brighter military green vs a moss green. that is throwing me a bit. not quite as versatile or neutral to me.  meanwhile  the styling with the
-1,Loved the color and the deshn. but when i put on  did not look right. waist was too short and the arms were long.
-1,"I love jumpsuits - except for this one. the fabric is blah. it's between plastic and the material that they make flags out of. the print is adorable and the buttons up the front are super cute. the tie thing that's just hanging there?  it's a tie thing that just hangs there. it doesn't  look good hanging  and it doesn't look good tied.  this jumpsuit had so much potential. i'm definitely disappointed.  for sizing reference  i am 5'5""  135  34c and a small was perfect."
0,I normally get a small in this style shirt but it didn't fit at all so i had to send it back. too bad
1,I bought this dress because i love the cut-out shoulder look and had been wanting to find something with this trend that i'd feel comfortable wearing. the dress fits well and the shoulder cut-out gives it a trendy look. i love the classic navy color. i was originally hesitant to buy it because of the slub material - which i've always thought to be a cheaper  thin cotton. the slub is more substantial than other slub tops i've seen elsewhere  so i was happy about that. still  it is made with slub
1,I saw the orange/tangerine colored version of this sweater and loved it. it looked beautiful on top. the chiffon material at the bottom of the sweater is a lovely detail. sadly  the bottom portion of the sweater made my hips look huge and i felt i looked pregnant. i weigh 111lbs. i am petite and small boned. i think it was because i am short waisted that this style did not suit me. i wish i could look good in this! it is absolutely exquisite in color and texture.
0,I bought 3 of these tops in different colors  the blue one had one sleeve noticeably shorter. sent it back. now less than 10 days later they are on sale. the style is darling and get many complements on the two i have. fyi i'm a 36d 130lbs and med fit great
-1,The design and style of shirt is quite cute -- but the mountain pictures is not mont blanc  nor does the mountain find itself near chamomix. it is an unmistakable image of the matterhorn and the small town of zermatt is at its base.
1,This pants look pretty much exactly like the picture except these will wrinkle really easily so there is no way they will ever appear as wrinkle free as the pic.  i found the color to be exactly as seen online so i am not sure why others didn't. the material is really light weight so i think these will work well for spring.  overall cute especially for the price. if not on sale  i would not have bought them but the sale price makes these pants awesome.
-1,"Again  nope. looks chic on the model  looked like a floor-length flannel nightgown on me. if you'd put a bonnet on me and stuck a candlestick in my hand  i could double for ebenezer scrooge in ""a christmas carol."" i believe the word i used to describe it when i tried it on was ""shmata"" (yiddish for ""rags). it looked like i was wearing a rag. the ruching didn't do anything to flatter my figure  the knit did not seem terribly warm for a sweater (felt more like rayon or nylon jersey than a knit swe"
1,I love this shirt. it is so soft. not boxy at all. very flattering. my only complaint is that there aren't more colors!
1,Beautiful dress  i like the length and cut. nice material. runs a bit big. i think it'll look nice with a belt. great colors.
0,"Like the idea of this longer tee/tunic to wear with leggings but i found it not flowly enough in my regular retailer size ( small). fit on top but not really on the bottom with the side slits. unflattering how the slits hit me. maybe for some one taller ( i am 5'3"")."
-1,I really wanted to love these  i bought them in a rush because i needed to replace my skinny jeans asap. they were a little long and didn't quite hug my calves but i figured with hemming they would be fine. i was told they wouldn't stretch out much. well  they fit great at the waist but the legs are now huge on me and i can't get them to shrink. wish i spent a little more on a different skinny jean. too late to return  so my hoping to be going out jeans are now lazy day jeans.
0,This top is gorgeous in both detail in color. it fit great and true to size  but then i hand washed it as instructed on the label and it shrank substantially to the point that it's now too short and needs to be returned.
0,I love tunics and really wanted this to work. i got this in a size s and it is absolutely gigantic. everything else about it is great  and i still haven't decided if i will try to swap it for an xs  which is definitely not my usual size (which is usually m  but often s at retailer). the pink/red color was quite pretty. if you have broad hips  fear not - you can size down and this top will still be generous around your hips. basically  if you're deliberating between s and m for this top  get
1,I think it's a little on the long side and the sleeves are a little tight but otherwise i really like this jacket. it's lightweight for summer and yet more stylish than the other long sleeve things i grab in case i get cold.
0,I'm usually a small but the skirt of the dress was a bit loose and added love handles to my figure when i wear it. a smaller size would work better. it's cute and i love it but the material is form fitting and do a larger size isn't flattering. an xsmall for me
1,This top is light and airy  but substantial enough to wear with shorts away from the beach. its definitely not too sheer to wear without a bathing suit. i was actually pleasantly surprised at the flattering fit. it runs slightly big  but the top is fitted enough that its not shapeless. the colors are beautiful and the embroidery makes it special.
0,I really wanted to love this top when i got it  but not so much. it fit nicely through the bust and torso  but flared out way too much  it ended up looking like a maternity top. maybe because i am more of an hourglass shape. another thing  it was very low cut  i would not have been able to wear this without a cami underneath. the fabric didn't seem to be the best quality  it also had a funny smell too it when i took it out of the package. this shirt was not worth the price. sadly  this was a mis
1,So this shirt is very cute  i like the drape (if you can get it arranged properly)  but it is not black  more of a charcoal bordering on heathered navy. i wear all black so it quite obviously stands out as a different color in my closet. i am keeping it  thinking i will wear it with leather  since it is flattering and the keyhole is something different. i am a true medium and bought the medium and it fits fine. a little shorter in the back but not a deal breaker.
0,I got this in the green color. it's a beautiful color  soft to the touch. i agree with other reviewers that it seems very delicate. i don't mind dry-cleaning my sweaters  so that's not the issue. the problem is that a. it runs huge - i got the small and it swims on me. i tend to run between small and medium in tops - very unusual to have a small be so big on me and b. the slits go even higher than they look on the model - they come up to the top of my waist. even with high-waisted pants  the sli
-1,This pants the worst short that i ever had!!  i bought ;this short last week and i laundry it yesterday and it came out lost color!!  i was really shock definetly will return it to store.  fyi  i never use chrolox or bleach when i laundry.
0,Dress runs very large. quality is great and the pockets are a great addition.
1,Some reviewers found this skirt to be on the smaller side  but for me  it was big    too bad the smaller size is sold out (well  all peittes are sold out). the length is also pretty long  below the knee  but in the narrow part still...so able to keep it. the colors are great. i brought it in the store to try on in front fo the stylists  adn they all loved it and told me to keep it... winner for sure!
1,Love this dress! it fits perfectly  is flattering  and the fabric is high quality. i ordered the blue print  and it is a vibrant turquoise. i may order in the charcoal as well  as this is a comfortable  cute dress for everyday casual. i am 5'7  135 lbs and the size 4 was perfect  even a tad bit loose  but i prefer a bit loose to tight  especially with the design with the buttons up the front.
0,I was not a fan. cute design but the sweater was not soft it felt thick like a weird blanket. the arms were small and the body was big... odd combo. the material didn't make me want to put it on. it went back.
-1,Should have listened 2 a previous review! while this is a very well made garment  it really does remind me of a bathrobe  and will be returning :( too bad because the fabric and stripes are really great. also...this runs very large. the extra small was more like a medium.
0,I'll start with saying that it's a beautiful coat- i get tons of compliments and love the color. it runs a little big but it's meant to have to a slouchy  oversized quality to it. my only complaint is that i've had it for about 3 weeks and already one button has completely fallen off and the two inside fasteners already feel loose and very delicate. there's no extra buttons to replace the old one with and i'm worried more of the coat is going to fall apart. super bummed about the construction qu
1,The color and fabric are really soft and lovely. it runs big so you can get away with a size smaller of even 2 sizes smaller. it would look great paired with leggings and boots and a long sweater coat or with skinny jeans and sandals. this is going to be my new favorite.
-1,I'm 5 ft 7 125 lbs true size 4 and these pants made me look like i had boy parts. super disappointed!
0,I really liked these jeans initially  but by the end of the day the waist is really baggy. the fabric stretches with wear and takes a wash to get back to its original shape.
0,"This picture does not do this skirt justice. it is gorgeous. however  the waist was so small that the sequins dug into my waist making me think of a medieval torture device. unfortunately  it was the largest size so i can't size up. i'm 4'11"" so the length was perfect - it came to right above my knees. i love the skirt so much that i'm considering liposuction."
1,This top is great and perfect for fall/winter. i've gotten a lot of wear out of this so far...great with jeans and sneakers for a casual look  or dress it up with black jeans and boots. great layering piece as well. the fabric is soft and comfortable. the fit is nice and relaxed  but tailored on the sides to give you some shape. the colors are beautiful.great buy  i highly recommend!
-1,This skirt looks great on  i didn't even think before buying it  planning to wear it all summer. so the aesthetic is great. quality and design  not so much. you get exactly one good wear out of it before the folding absolutely disintegrates  it is not sewn in or built to last.     then  it looks like a cheap sarong over a cheap miniskirt. i thought the dry cleaner might be able to fix it  but they said they would have to resew the whole garment  not exactly what you want to hear with almost bran
0,While i love the green color and the soft waffle knit of this top it was so wide i could have fit two of me standing side by side into it!  i mean it was truly laughable!  don't know what the manufacturer was thinking but this one needs to go back to the drawing board.
0,These jeans fit perfectly. however  the distress at the knee was a bit too distressed for my taste. i would recommend these jeans for a younger demographic.
0,"This dress has great potential. i happen to have a longer torso so the fit was off. as a previous review stated  it's short waisted and a lot a skirt which i agree  the hem is also funky. i am still deciding if i want to keep it  but if i do  i plan on altering the skirt to be narrower and hemming it a bit shorter too. for reference  i'm 5'3"" and weigh 110 and i purchased a size 0."
1,"I am not really a ""print person"" but cartonnier gets it right every time - modern prints that lend themselves to many styling and paring options. the charlie trouser  which they do every season  is a great fitting pant (going up a size is a must as they do run small) with details (stitching  buttons  pockets) that make their pants look more expensive than they actually are. i bought these in the blue combo when i saw them at my local retailer store. the blue combo has both blue and black (as well"
1,"Love this with leggings or jeans for a casual look. quality seems ok  though i'm hoping for no shrinkage after i wash since it's the perfect length at the moment (i'm 5'7"" and it just covers my butt). good sale purchase!"
-1,These look nothing like the picture! they are super high-waisted & longer than they look in this picture. i felt as if i was wearing a pair of jeans from the 90's that just fit terribly. i thought they were going to be a pair of cropped wide legs & they are far from it. the color was also much lighter than shown in picture. super unflattering & just not for me. they're going back...
1,Love this dress! it is super-flattering  and the embroidery is beautiful.
0,The quality of the fabric is soft and thick and well made. loved everything about it but if you are ample in the chest  it is snug and does not hang and drape as well like on the model  so you may want to size up. i am sending it back as the fit is not flattering on me for the price. someone with a boyish no-curve figure would look dynamite in it!
1,Just tried this on in store. the color in the photo is wayyyyy off. it's a hunter green and dark navy zigzag. for maeve it runs large. i am usually a medium or a 10 and a s worked best. i'm a 36d and there was no pull at the bust. will pick up when on sale (bc a hundo for rayon is laughable).
-1,This looks like the perfect easy sweater with the white shirt appeal to it  but sadly the fit of this number is really off. it looks more like a tent. it must have been clipped in the back or something. i cannot see any scenario in which this would look good...
1,I own several of retailer's kimonos  & this has to be the prettiest. the colors are rich & more beautiful in person. i can't wait to pair this with jeans & shorts this summer!
-1,I would have kept this dress if it weren't for the giant arm holes and reveal my entire bra on both sides. other than that  it looks just like it does on the model and is a nice  substantial material.
1,I fell in love with this on-line and when it arrived today i think i love it even more because the white portion of this sweater is really a medium pink color which looks so chic. although i am not usually into pink  this looks so stylish with the pink instead of the white. this is a piece you might find in a vintage store in the village in nyc. can't wait for it to get chilly so i can wear it. for reference  i am 5'1  36c chest and the small fit perfect. the quality is really high end as well.
0,This jacket runs very large. i usually wear an xl but probably could fit into a medium. i have long arms  and the sleeves were way past my hands. i love the jacket  but it's just too sloppy.
0,I wanted to love these pants  but they were larger than i expected and the fabric is very heavy. almost like a thick sweater.
0,First of all  the fabric's summery pattern of blossoms  honeybees and butterflies is beautiful and absolutely unique. i love it so much i wish i could afford to keep the dress as an art object. also  with one important exception  the dress is well made. the underslip is the right length and opacity. the dress is not transparent   which is a big plus. there is a slight greenish cast to the background instead of the pure ivory shown  in the pictures. this makes the color a bit harder to wear. and
1,I really like this top  a nice spin on a class sweatshirt. fun with a pair of jeans or cords.
-1,I loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric. i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned. totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge. maybe if you size down it would be better- xs was not available for me to try. also the lavender color is really washed out...
-1,The suit is lovely  but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg. i was told that it runs small and to size up to a 10. i did  but i do not think the smaller one would have done better. the bust is fake and it turns out when untied. worst of all it emphasizes the tummy. all in all not a good look for me. i am not heavy but i do need tummy support. normally i wear an 8 and in garnet hill a 6. sorry but it went back. i really wanted to like it.
0,I wish his dress would have worked. it is beautiful!! however  the waist and bust runs very small. the bottom of the dress does flare out a bit but the waist is so tight that unless you are a stick  everything at your waist and hips will stick out.
1,Love this top. the beautiful and delicate details are wonderful. the cut is a loose fit which is great. it works with tailored trousers and jeans
1,"I'm barely 5'4"" and rarely find a maxi that isn't far too long or the other extreme. i prefer mine to just barely reach the ground as opposed to rising 5 inches from the floor for example. this one is perfect with flat sandals. i tried on the 4 and chuckled b/c it was 6"" too long. tried on the 2 and not only was it the perfect length  the bodice fit like a glove. i would say i'm average bust size  always fluctuating but not generally flat-chested. i prefer more conservative sleeveless dresses an"
-1,This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came
