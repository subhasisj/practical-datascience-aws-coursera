0,I love the color blocking but dress hangs a little strange on me. love the pockets  thought about sending it back and decided it is very comfortable  i will wear it but not quite what i was hoping for.
0,This sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy. the fit is larger around the arms and chest  which might work well for people who are very curvy on top. it seems to taper a bit to the waist. the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape. it was too overwhelming on my petite frame  what with the bold flower and the fit  so i passed. but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater  this could work well for you.
0,This top reminded me of a maternity top. cute  but better suited for someone smaller chested.
0,I love the pattern on this jacket and enjoy the bell shape. a fun jacket to through on and add quick style to a skinny pants.
1,This pullover is great for lounging! so warm and cozy!
-1,As others have said  this is cropped  so will look funny with most pants that aren't high waisted. i'm going to try it with a few dresses before i return it. the lining is adorable  so i don't want to have to send it back.
-1,The material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful! it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area. it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward.
-1,C'mon. the accent is wrong! a simple google search would prevent this.
0,I love this dress now that it is on sale; sized down to sm petite  added a simple full slip. endless compliments and inquiries on where to buy it!
1,I ordered this online  having never seen it in person. i loved it as soon as i touched the soft material. it fits me perfectly...i almost invariably wear a size 6 in retailer dresses and tops  which gave me the confidence to order online  and this dress is true to size. the detailing at the bosom is so flattering. the fabric is supple and hangs gracefully without clinging to my not-so-perfect waistline. i have worn this twice already  having received it only a week ago. the blue/black combi
1,Tried this on and loved it! chic  lightweight  warm  cute left as is and cuter belted. ended up letting a friend buy it since it was the last one but will be adding to my iso list for sure!
1,These are so cute... i went into the store to buy something else and came out with these. i usually wear a 10 and bought a medium. these are also lower price than i expected. also  well constructed. thank you antho!!
0,Beautiful dress  wonderful fabric  very well made  just runs really small! so sad  i wanted this dress for a special event!
0,I really wanted this top to work but i felt that it was big and boxy. it's shorter in the front and longer in the back. the seam and peplum hit at a strange place and made me look disheveled. it's definitely worth trying on  but didn't fit me.
0,"My review of the pros : 1) quality made  not see through in any way  can wear with small bra straps 2) lace gives the top a 'different look""  really liked it. my review of the cons  which made me return the top 1) runs huge!!! i am 5'2""  36 small c  broad shoulders and my usual size medium looked like an xl. it was large in the bust area and almost 'puckered' at the armpits? i would probably order 2 sizes down to an xs  which i never wear in any size top. 2) for petite gals (i am 5'2"")  this a a"
-1,This white shirt is very thin esp in the front and see through - i would have to wear a cami underneath unless i wanted people to see the outline of my bra. it seems very flimsy and poor quality  even at the sale price. disappointed and will return...
1,I ordered this in a large and its a super cute dress but this time the large ran super big! i usually wear a 10 so sometimes mediums are too small. i'm going to exchange it for a medium and see if that fits better. the beading detail is beautiful but just had too much fabric down below.
0,I wanted to love these great spring/summer pants  but sadly  they are just too unflattering for ladies with hips. if you have a ruler build  these pants will be fantastic  but these pants are not forgiving in the hip and thigh area for those of you blessed with a curvier build. i was really hoping for pants that had this clean  vintage inspired  audrey hepburn look re-imagined for the every-girl  because nothing is more flattering to an hourglass body than clean  non-bulky lines (something like
-1,I wanted to love this dress  it looks beautiful on the model but it isn't the flattering  even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it  it it runs pretty big.
1,I bought the lavender in my normal large. the fabric drapes wonderfully and does not cling to my midsection. the texture of the fabric is much more interesting than the photos online show. there is beautiful shimmer tot he heather in the color. in my lavender shirt there is pink/gray/lavendar/white/silver depth to the fabric. i plan on getting at least two more colors.     i recommend washing all shirts like this in a nylon bag in the machine  then line drying. i have done this for years with al
0,Comfortable and soft material  cute design and nice longer length..however  i'm long waisted and this looked ridiculous on my me  elastic came up right under my bra and not at my waist. would be cute for someone shorter.
-1,I wanted a comfortable and loose casual dress. i liked the pictures and decided to give it a try.  the dress turned out to be too loose (i got size 4 after checking the measurements chart  i'm 5'7' 125 lb and usually wear s). i could practically wrap myself in this dress. besides  it looks a bit too long (well  i'm not as tall as the model in the photos and i don't like wearing high heels).  the material looks faded  not as bright as in the pictures. i like distressed and vintage style  but this
-1,I usually love a cowl neck sweater but not this one. you can't wear it off the shoulders and it's weirdly sheer too. the only pro is that it doesn't include wool or fur.
-1,Very cute top. i went down a size because for me it was a little large in the back  but that was just my taste. i purchased the denim print.
1,This skirt is really beautiful and well made. the color is a cream/off white like other reviewers mentioned. it fits mostly true to size--i have a straight build with a wider stomach and no hips and my usual 4 fit a tad tight in the waist but perfect in the hips. i just love this skirt.
-1,Cute in theory  i love the bright colors  the tied black collar sash and the 70's vibe  however  the fabric is cheap  and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern. maybe this was intentional  but with the shirt i received  it looked horrible. i sent it back. i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam  so it is a bit deceiving. i wouldn't buy this top at any price based on
-1,I love good  flowy blouses and like the over sized look  but this one didn't wow me. i thought the quality was just ok. it didn't flatter me. i almost liked it  but i didn't. i'm glad i tried it on  because looking at the pics online i thought i'd like it way more than i did. just not great.
0,...for real  reinforce all the buttons before you wear it out. i've had three different ones pop right off.
-1,Loved the design but jacket looked like 20 years old because of a lot of piling even brand new jacket at store. i wish they use better quality fabric so i would have purchased it.
1,This is a classic pencil dress that would be becoming on most straight figures. i always wear a 6 (or medium) in hd  and this dress is a little large everywhere. i love it so much  i paid full price and i will probably have it taken in on the sides if possible. the lacework is gorgeous and sturdy - it doesn't catch on stuff. there is a lot of give to sit and move in  unlike most pencil dresses  and i cannot say enough about the color. wow  heads turn when you walk into a room in this gorgeous de
-1,The material that was used to make this top is very thin and poor quality. it feels like the type of material that will disintegrate after one wash. i normally wear an xl and this top is huge and not flattering. returning asap.
1,Love this skirt. very comfy. looks like it's very expensive material but feels comfortable.
-1,As the other reviewer said  the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous. i don't know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip. i'm long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well. very very strangely constructed-i couldn't keep it even at the deeply discounted price
-1,This sweater looked so promising with the tie waist and pretty lacy edging  but turned out to be a disappointment. it was much shorter than it looks in the photos and barely came to my hips. and the plum color was much darker than i expected  more of a dull brownish-burgundy.
1,I liked this online but loved it when i received it in the mail. i normally wear a m/l and the medium fit perfect. it is gorgeous and flattering with a tie at the waist. the bottom is flowy. i knew it would be sheer from the reviews so that wasn't a surprise but i really wish it came lined. no one wants to wear a slip to the beach and i feel it's too nice for a cover up.
1,I bought this a little ago in the denim color. it has become a favorite so much that i bought another in white.
0,I tried this on at the store  and though it was pretty  i was a little underwhelmed. it fit but had no give so it might not have been too comfortable for movement unless sized up. the embroidered polka dots were a lovely idea  but the quality was not great - they were already fraying and pretty irregular looking. the idea of the top was better than the execution.
-1,It is such a cute design and very soft and comfortable  but the picture for this product is very deceiving! it looks like the sweater is fairly long in the pictured product page  but it is considerably short. i am nearly six foot tall  but thought by this picture it would be lengthy  not at all! it is a beautiful sweater  might work better for a shorter stature.
0,I wanted to love this dress because the color is so amazing  but the arm holes are huge! i am petite and tried this on and it just sadly didn't work.
-1,A beautiful shawl but not practical. i was impressed with how elegant/romantic it first felt/looked.  however  after 5 minutes of wear  it would not stay on my shoulders. the design is very awkward and despite several attempts with different tops/tanks underneath  i kept running into the same problem. lovely for the first 5 minutes of wear and then awkwardly/annoyingly wouldn't stay on my shoulders. the neckline is undefined and it just fell off. not a great design. disappointedly returned it.
1,"The romper is well made and just plain cute. i bought it the second i saw it and don't regret my impulse buy one bit. 135 5'5"" and the small fit perfectly."
0,"This was my favorite shirt before i ordered it .... i absolutely couldn't wait to wear it.  but i was so disappointed.  at 5'2"" and 120 i have a athletic frame ... the small was tight in the shoulders but had so much extra fabric that i felt lost.  i wasn't wearing the shirt .... it was wearing me."
0,This top was so pretty online! unfortunately it did not work for me- the front was a bit more shapeless in person  though the back was gorgeous  with a button gather at center. the color appeared yellow online  but was a bit more green in person. also  the armholes were very low  so it would need a camisole or no bra.
1,I ordered this dress online and didn't really know what to expect. but to my surprise  it's exactly what i had hoped it would be. the dress is a fantastic fit and has a modern  interesting print. the fabric does seem thin for the price. but i am not returning it. it's a casual summer dress that kicks up my look a notch on weekends. i wear it with beige sandals  and the gray and beige look good together too.
1,I love the way the dress fit definitely a flip flop by the poolside bar dress. i ordered the mango colored one and was disappointed that the color resembled a dark squash orange and not as bright as it looked in picture. i think it will look nice with a tan so i will keep it. wouldn't plan to dress it up too much because it will definitely wrinkle ! i am a petite 5'4 and got the regular and it fits just above my knees which is good for my taste!
0,This skirt is not what i was expecting at all. for starters it runs large  i expected it to sit at the natural waist and it is definitely made to do so  but it was a good two inches too big and therefore wouldn't lay flat and gaped at the front. no bueno. my biggest gripe  though  is that the color looks nothing like it does in the picture. they have it paired with an ivory top and the two look like they match so well but do not be fooled  the background color of this skirt is not even close to
-1,I'm not sure why this dress is getting great reviews. the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh. it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i've every tried on at retailer. i'm 5'4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume.
1,"I tried these on in the store today and fell in love. they fit/drape beautifully and are incredibly comfortable while looking stylish. i'm 5'7"" and 128 lbs. and the 27 (a 4  i guess) fit perfectly. sadly  i can't afford them full price so will keep my eye on them in case they go on sale."
-1,I bought these and returned them almost immediately. the material looks nice  but itchy and heavy. the fit is too small and just uncomfortable to wear.
0,I love these pants -- bought them in the mustard color. my only complaint is that they are not colorfast -- i washed them in cold water with other colored items -- most of which belonged to my husband. not good -- and pretty much ruined an entire load of laundry except for these pants. retailer -- please color test your garments. there is really no excuse for fabrics like this to run in this day and age!
-1,I was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person. the fabric is a rough gauzy texture. the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something  they do not hang or move well on the body. also  they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off. sadly  these are going back.
-1,Good quality fabric and structure but the mix media details and lines make them seem more like jodphurs than leggings. it's hard to see where i would wear them ... sorry but they have to go back.
1,Love love love this mock tank!!! goes fabulous with everything! it's flows nicely the mock neck looks fantastic! you can probably go one size down.
0,I'm normally between a 4-6 in retailer dresses. i had to go up to a size 10 just to get the buttons across the chest to close and lay properly without feeling like i would bust out. definitely not for those with any kind of chest.
1,Beautiful dress! vibrant colors. fabric has a nice weight and drapes perfectly. 36 dd up top and the girls have plenty of space.
0,The colors on this jacket are a murky blue with a pale mauve tone for the lighter color. size is a bit on the large size. i did not feel that the jacket was that well-made and would hold up to much wear. i was looking for a jacket to dress up jeans  black pants etc and this did not fit that need. it would be a warm jacket if that is a need.
1,In love with this. as soon as i received it in the mail i ordered another color. super soft and easy to wear. i imagine i will live in this top the rest of the summer. felt pricey  but worth it for as much wear as i will get out of it. i am 5'10  160 and the large is a great fit. perfect fit on the shoulders and just a hair loose throughout the rest of the tank  which is what i wanted.
0,These are cute and light weight however the fit is off. i ordered my normal size large (i'm a 12/14.). the waist was large but fit ok. they were really tight across the theighs. the crop length is fine with my 5'9 height. if i hadn't got such a good sale of probably return them. they will be good lounge pants.
0,I love the colors of this top. it does run very large though. when i received my usual small i felt like i was swimming in the top  not fitted at all. the material is a bit funky too - seems a little lower quality because of the fabric. will return and try a smaller size if there is one available at the store and see if i change my mind.
0,I am a pretty consistent size 2 or 26. ordered these in my usual 26 and  yikes  right out of the package knew they''d be way to small. they have a lot of stretch in them so i was able to get them buttoned but they were wayyyy too small and looked awful. i returned them for a 27 which i am still waiting for. i'll update this review when they arrive. other than the size issue  they were just as pictured/expected.
1,The colors and design are stunning in person. it is one-size and as most kimonos go it is billowy and flowing  and not fitted. i plan to wear it with a pair of black shorts and also with black leggings. i love the idea of layering this over shorts. i have a similar kimono and wear it as a bating suit cover-up. the long kimono over short looks fresh and modern and gives you the option to have some coverage when you want it. also  really pops over simple black leggings and black top. it's light an
-1,It's beautiful  lovely quality  gorgeous bird. but the fit just doesn't work for me. i'm usually a medium  which is what i got  it's just too tight in the chest. for ref 36d. as is it already flares out some in the bottom so i'm not gonna bother w a larger size unfortunately
-1,This looks cute in the web photo  unfortunately it is absolutely huge in person. i got the small and have to return it because it is not wearable for me.
-1,I ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it  not only was it too long  but there was also a hole in it. so i returned it. when a small petite became available  i ordered it thinking it would fit better. i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well. both skirts also looked as if they had been worn; there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts. i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it's really bad quality.
-1,Was very surprised when i opened the package  this dress is very thin fabric and you need to wear a half slip as it is see through. the top of the dress is short to the draw string and does not drape bloused style at all. i have a short waist length so it should have worked. the color is a little darker than pictured  but over all looks cheap so full price with tax makes it way over priced. going back asap.
0,The top is a pretty and has a nice pattern. it does run large and is it a bit billowy. i am 5'4 petite and ordered a small ( maybe the xs would have been better). however  the top swallowed me up and was unflattering. the colors are true to the picture..not very bright  but would be a nice transition to fall top.  the feel of the blouse was nice and maybe if i was taller and ordered a smaller size it would have been better.
1,Cute top but does stretch out a bit throughout the day.
1,"As the title suggests  i am very skeptical and scared of pencil skirts. i'm slim (sz 0) and on the shorter side (5'4'')  but i have ""dramatic hips""  so i've always had a testy relationship with any clothing that exaggerates them. i'm obsessed with uniquely designed skirts thought  so i had to try this and i am so pleased i did!  the fit is great and not too tight  allows for a little room for ladies with hips. i only wish the zipper went down a little further so shimmying out of it were a little"
1,This skirt is so cute. the fix print is really nice. it's a great piece to add to the fall wardrobe.
1,Wish i had snagged both styles of this shirt before they sold out. this is a very cute  work appropriate top - good weight and quality to the shirt. i wear a lot of black and white at work (so sick of gray..why are all business clothes gray?) and this top will be added into my regular rotation.
1,Saturday/sunday never disappoints! love this black cardigan. runs a tad large i noticed in the arm length for me. not a problem anywhere else though. good medium weight to the fabric. durable quality and waist flattering once tied. great for throwing on over a dress  wearing with a t-shirt
0,I thought these would be nice  and they are but then i started thinking that the bejewels will eventually be out of style and these can't be as much of a classic... also  the jewels make the jeans feel heavier.   fit is like most boyfriend/girlfriend jeans  slightly loose (not as much on me due to muscles) and length on petite was close to what is shown here (typical for me that it is still a bit longer  as not only am i short  but i have short legs for my shortness!)    so if you want that styl
