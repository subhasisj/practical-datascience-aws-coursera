0,I did not realize that this knitted vest had an attached gauzy under-layer. i can see it now in the photo  but i just thought it wasn't part of the actual vest. when the vest arrived i realized sadly that this flowing under-layer was part of the design. i don't know why because the yarn and vest are lovely without it. in my opinion  the under-layer takes away from the beautiful vest. i guess i could have spent some time and removed it  but at that price i just sent it back. too bad because the m
0,This top has dry clean only. didn't like the fabric. plus mine was a return. i also returned it because the left arm has a hole. now it's for sale again. if your looking to buy a large. don't.
1,I really liked this tank. i purchased it in the green. i went with my regular size 2. yes it's boxy but it's a nice tank that will get lots of use this summer. i'm planning on using it on our vacation to the beach . it is thin and soft.
1,"I love these pants. i vary between 10 & 12  the 10 fit perfectly since they are designed on the fuller size  perfect for my body type of small waist and a bit of bottom. so many colors to coordinate with these pants. teal green  ""retailer"" yellow  black...i am not fond of ankle pants  prefer longer pants. i took the cuffs down and lengthened the pants. the only problem is that these pants are so exquisitely made  removing the cuff tacks was a challenge! perfect pants for those of us who have shape"
0,I'm 5'7  125lbs  and the small fits perfectly. the sleeves are the right length (i have long arms and legs)  and the body fits loosely  without looking sloppy. at my height  the small is not long enough to wear as a tunic  which is fine.    unfortunately  the shirt arrived with makeup stains around the laces and the inside of the shirt  so i had to wash it before wearing it.    i only purchased this shirt because it was on sale.
-1,I ordered this after reading through the reviews. i realize the reviews were mixed  but thought i'd take a chance. unfortunately there were more things wrong than right with this dress. right: i loved the various colors (yes  it shows black but is actually brown). i also loved that it was lined and the lining was semi-attached to the dress  with the same hi-to-low hemline. wrong: as said by others  the sleeves were very tight! the dress is roomy and does swing but unlike the model  it isn't real
1,This shirt is so comfortable and looks very nice with jeans or work pants. it's a great shirt!
1,This is a heavier weight shirt. it is fitted through the bust and shoulders and very loose below so  if you don't like loose fitting clothes  this is not for you. it is well made and looks cute with jeans.
1,"Just received yesterday & i love this skirt! it's crazy soft  very flow-y and the higher slits on each side let it be more sexy than hippie-looking which i appreciate. great to pair with a funky pair of tights underneath. sits nicely on your body - hugs your curves.  only annoyance is it's a bit awkward to walk in as the material moves around your legs & gets caught a bit. you definitely have to be conscious of it as you walk.  i bought a m in gray which fit perfectly (i'm 5'9"" & usually a 6). t"
-1,"Three strikes and retailer is out for me! i am so disappointed. i really liked this dress and was looking for a fun  distinctive new shift dress. got it  tried it on  took it off  went back to look at the listing online...nowhere does it mention that it has a drop-seam in the shoulders. i guess you can see it if you zoom in closely on the image  but it's not mentioned in the text. who on god's green earth actually looks good with a drop-shoulder?! it hits every woman under 5'10"" right in the middl"
0,I'm a bit disappointed in this top. i'm keeping because retailer's shipping rates are obnoxious and i don't have a store near me. by the time i pay for shipping both ways  i could have paid for 1/2 the shirt. the loft has some very similar tops for about 1/2 the price. i love meadow rue  and their material is fabulous  but the design is off on this one. you can't size down because the armholes and top are fitted  but the bottom is a tent. not my usual style  as i'm short  with a short waist. this
-1,I ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve. i am very disappointed  because i love the sweater. by the time it arrived  it was sold out in my size. now  i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged. if the sweater was not damaged  i would recommend this product.
1,I originally purchased a small after reading some of the reviews. although it did fit  i felt it was just slightly snug across the chest and upper arms. i returned for a medium (my usual size) and it was perfect. it had the same look and flow as what you see in the model pics. i love love love that it is long-sleeved and has pockets!!!!! i went ahead and ordered the other print as well! i wore the first one to work with some knee high boots and got many compliments. highly recommend!
0,First of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl. the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways. if you wear it so it's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa. my only big complaint is that i've worn it twice and there's already a large hole in the arm seam. poor construction which is disappointing. hopefully mine was a one-off. i'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale.
-1,This looks nothing like it does on the website. it runs small and the colors are so muddy. it doesn't drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short  stiff and plain ugly. sent it back immediately.
0,Has anybody washed this shirt a second time? just curious if it continues to shrink.
1,These pants have quickly become my go to spring pant. comfortable and a long enough crop for my 5'8 legs  almost closer to the ankle which i prefer. i wore them 3 times with out washing and they did stretch out a bit but there is a set of buttons in the hip if i really needed them tighter there. i bought the darker color  its a mossy green/grey. it looks sharp with the tla black v-neck t shirt.
-1,Fabric felt and looked cheap.  hem was completely frayed  all the way around  perhaps purposely  but ratty looking  all the same.
-1,I was expecting a nice golden yellow color but what i received was very dull in color with greenish undertones. very disappointed. will be returning.
-1,"I was excited to get this shirt in the mail  i liked the pattern a lot  but was so disappointed when i tried it on. i am 5'4""  130 lbs. and wear a c cup so i tried ordering a small as a starting point. there was enough fabric on the sides to make another shirt! despite the excess fabric  the shirt pulled open in the chest area  making it a complete fail. i'm sure the model in the photo must have the shirt clipped in the back to pull in the excess fabric  especially since she's small on top. ther"
0,While these seem like interesting designs which i applaud!  the execution in the design of the fabric is not appealing.
0,I purchased this dress yesterday and it's cute and fits great  but the embroidery across the back ripped as soon as i moved my arms. it's really delicate and strains anytime you lift your arms overhead or forward. i'm keeping it anyway because the supersoft pretty slip that come with it is worth the sale price.
0,"I found this dress to be beautiful. only down side? you'd need to size up two sizes if you have any breasts or butt. i'm usually size s/m in maeve. i bought this in l and looked like a stuffed sausage. i'm 5'1""  140lbs  36d  39"" hips. i'd need an xl."
1,I purchased the blue version in store. it's a nice royal blue  not navy. (although the it could be worn with navy.) i thought the fit was flattering. the middle piece (pleat?) is less obvious on the blue than the purple. the tie at the neck can be untied and it is still not too low cut.
0,I am a true size small and i ordered this dress and it was way big. it's meant to be a relaxed fit  but it sagged under the arm-holes because the bust was way too big. some folks are saying it ran small and they are essentially the same measurements as me  so it makes me think there is possibly some variation in each size. i got on here to reorder in a smaller size  but now am not sure what to do as i need a dress with in the next three days!
0,Color is pretty true to pic  a bright blue red.  sleeves have more volume than pic.  so does the body.  in my opinion.  maybe if i looked like the model.  i wear a 27 in jeans and it doesn't look so cute on me.  also i'm a brunette.  angles?  pinning?  i have to wonder.  probably just pics at good angles.  it looks really cute on the model though.
0,Beautiful top but it didn't fit. i am small chested with wide shoulders  normally wear a xs or s - ordered the xs and it swallowed me.
0,This is a beautiful dress. the lace top is stunning! the fit is true to size  and there's no stretch. i had the same problem as other reviewers... that darn zipper. it's so small and gets hung up easily. i could see it eventually failing in the future.
-1,"I agree with the other reviewer: the snaps at the ankle are a cute idea  but bad in execution. they look and feel odd when on. ---------- these fit tts  and they are soft with decent stretch. but the rise is much lower on me than other 8.5"" rise jeans i have; as a 43 year-old woman they seemed inappropriately low-hanging on me. ---------- as an aside  these will def. color transfer - there is a whole lotta rinse on these. and they have a strange chemical smell to them; not sure if that will diss"
1,This jumpsuit is the epitome of what i love about retailer! unique and absolutely beautiful. i love how it flows and on my petite frame when paired with heels makes me look taller. hopefully the designs for spring/summer are just as beautiful and comfortable as this piece. i plan to rock this with a cute belt and a bolo jacket.
1,"I am 5 feet and 120. i ordered a petite small in moss. i have posted a photo below. it's a pretty green. the lining is pretty. the reason i deducted a star is because the lining is very thin and ""slips"" a little when putting the jacket on. but it doesn't effect the way the jacket falls and i wear it comfortably. it's floppy  but not sloppy. i was surprised that each side the fabric is like a tulip. it was a nice surprise. i'm curvy and busty. i have zero problem with it being unflattering. the s"
0,I have been looking for a basic ivory sweater. i waited for this one to go on sale. the style is cute but the sweater itself is very stiff and heavy. unfortunately i decided to return it.
-1,I love the color patterns and fabric.  it has full lining!  my biggest problem with the dress is the swing style - makes it more like a maternity dress and so unflattering?  a straight (shift) style would have been much better.  dress runs large  however the arm/shoulder area is tight.
0,Honestly  the sweater is really beautiful...i usually buy a small in retailer tops  and this seemed to run on the smaller side. it&#39;s pretty short  but the issue i have is that the sleeves are much shorter in person than on the models in the pictures. it looks like i&#39;m wearing a 3/4 sleeve shirt. still deciding if i&#39;m going to keep it  because it is really a lovely top.
1,And runs large. i'm always a size 8 in dresses and the 8 was too big. i would buy it in a 6 if the color was closer to what i'm seeing online.
-1,I love everything about this except the length. i am short and usually order a petite and even this is really cropped on me. the quality is good  thick and substantial  color is great but very cropped and sleeves are long on me as well. just weird proportions so sadly  going back.
-1,The tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo. one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing. very disappointing. i wish i had found the hole before i try them on. they are definitely going back.
1,I ordered this as a gift and may order myself one. it is so comfortable and pretty.
1,Classic retailer piece that i am so happy to have in my wardrobe. high quality all wool felt jacket. unlined  stretchy comfortable knit. i wear mine as a knit blazer and love it. it is not merino soft  but soft enough to wear over a long sleeve tee. the neck does not itch.     fits tts  i wear a l and that is my normal retailer size. i am tempted to get the cream as well!
0,I agree with the other reviewer  this is a nice piece. i felt so-so about it when i tried it on though. see below.    ___________  pros:  - not too heavy or warm due to being part linen/cotton blend  making it breathable and great for more milder temperatures.  - soft floral arrangements with lovely pattern throughout the sweater.  - lovely collar giving it a sophisticated feel.  - ran tts. i'm 5'9  hourglass with some meat on my bones and found the medium to be an ideal fit.  ___________  cons:
0,"This beauty caught my eye online and i was excited to see it in store. the coloring is lovely  but it was too short for me (5'7"") and just meh...and it was only on for a second before it started itching. sadly  too  the sleeves were all stretched out from the way my local store merchandised it  which looks cute on the hanger but kind of ruins the clothes (i wish they'd stop doing this). if it works for you  great because it's a decent price for a timeless sweater with an interesting color patter"
1,Best part: covers my bum. perfect for teaching  casual girls' night or casual date night.  my only complaint is there aren't other colors. awful decision. i would have purchased at least 5 of these at the right price.
-1,"I really wanted to love this sweater however it fell much shorter on my 5'10"" frame than it falls on the model  between my belly button and hip  and the sleeves ended just below my elbow and were much more voluminous than they appear in the product shot. i do have long monkey arms though  so on someone more petite it would probably fit more like the model shot.  the quality of the knit seems nice  however the zipper used is very slim and light weight and got stuck twice just while i was trying i"
-1,"I got this dress and the material was super fuzzy and itchy. the prior reviews stated it was ""warm and cozy"" and not itchy at all  but i found it to be uncomfortably so. the dress was true to size for me and the length was good. i loved the plaid in the material just wished the material had been more soft and not rough. the material reminded me of mohair."
-1,The front cream panel is completely transparent.i didn't purchase because my bra showed and it would ruin the look with a cami underneath.  i wish the fabric were translucent - not so see through.
-1,I was very disappointed when it arrived and had elbow length sleeves. from the photo  it looked like full length sleeves. it went back.
-1,Appears much more sleek in the photograph. in real life  this shirt looks more like a pajama top. thin  extremely casual  not worth the price i paid- even in black. will be exchanging it tomorrow.
1,"I love  love  love this top! the color is beautiful  a pinkish-orange  about exactly how it looks online. it is soft and light weight for summers. it does run a little big  i debated between a 0 and a 2 and ended up with a 2  i'm almost 5'7"" and 130lbs for reference. it wings out on the sides at first  once i steamed it at home and relaxed the fabric a bit it draped nicely  so don't let that turn you off from it when trying it on! part of the design is cut out through out as a warning "
0,"Pros: soft  quality top  true to size  and would look great (a little tucked in) and off the shoulder    reality: it will be hard to keep the shoulders from sliding up  and (on me at least) it looked really meh...kind of dumpy.    i'm 5'6""  normally a medium/8  and i bought the medium here...fit was good. it's billowy and accurately displayed in the pictures  so as an hour-glass shaped gal  i'd need to tuck in the front (or all) or accessorize to give it a little shape. i really liked the feel a"
-1,I looked at this dress for a long time before i purchased it because of the money. i wear a size 2p. was entirely disappointed in the style and construction of this dress. for one thing the lining is bulky and you could never wear it in warmer weather without burning up. the dress as pictured looks very feminine and light weight silk but there is just too much material going on--- thick and heavy. the overall fit was too big and very unflattering.
1,"I ordered the black 2 months ago  it was on back order  and i jsut received it finally. the fabric is super soft  itried on both xxs and xs and could keeo either one. the ""v"" in front where it crosses is low  so most people do need a cami underneath  but you could probably do without for ultra sexy look (not my style  but could be done). i plan on wearing this with skirts  deresses and slacks... i saw a commet on the lighter color  not sure  but love this one in black for sure@"
1,I love this top! it's well-made (important if you're in chlorine or salt water) and has vibrant colors. the back strap has two clasp options  so not much room for adjustment but i like this fastening method because you don't have a big bow to lay on when laying out.
-1,Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.
1,I purchased the medium in this sweater as that was all that was left. but it fit like a large if not an xlarge! it's a beautifully made sweater and really soft. i now think i know why it suddenly becomes available again here and there. it's not the kind of sweater you want to wear over sized because as beautifully made as it is  it's not that flattering if it's hanging on you. luckily it suddenly became available in a small which i quickly ordered and will keep my figures crossed that it's bette
-1,I purchased this top in the rose and steel blue colors even though the majority of reviews says it shrinks even when you wash per the instructions. i called the local retailer store first to see if it could be returned if this happened and they said yes  no problem. well the reviews are correct. i washed just the rose colored top so i could compare it to the steel blue if it did shrink. i am returning them this evening. i will not take the time or spend the money to dry clean a tank. it is made ve
1,This is seriously a beautiful dress. it has such gorgeous colors. it's lined so no slip needed. it is flowy and just the right length. i went with a petite and it is perfect.. can't wait to use it at the beach.
-1,The beadwork is gorgeous  but the sleeves are so puffy  it looks as though you're wearing shoulder pads. the fabric of the shirt isn't that fabulous either.
0,These were a little baggier than expected and the petite size ran long.
1,"I felt compelled to write a review to tell everyone to size up. i am 5'4""  130 lbs  34d and normally wear a size 4 (give or take). i debated between the 6 & 8 after reading the reviews and went with the 8 and so glad i did! if you're in doubt between sizes even after sizing up  go up one more  especially if you're bigger up top. mine fit *okay* in them but probably could have even done better with a larger cup. what's weird is that they sew in liner cups so you can't remove them without cutting"
0,"I *loved* the brown color on the model  and i love the wrap style in general. however  i'm not sure if the color looks as goon on me. i first ordered my standard size small (5'7""  137 lbs 32 b)  which fit  but exchanged it for the looser fit (medium) shown in the pictures. i really like that the material is a thin  but not see through cotton. it has an extra cotton layer lining in front which is nice. the v isn't too low on me  so i don't *have* to wear a cami under. not really crazy about the s"
1,"I have come to scoop up basically ever elevenses jumpsuit that they release because they are perfection - always the perfect fit and quality fabric. i'm on the taller side at 5'7"" and found this to fit perfectly  yet somehow it looks equally as perfect on shorter ladies i saw in the dressing room. awesome!"
-1,I thought the dress was ok  but was surprised by the cut away triangles of material right under bra band on the sides of dress. i will send back  also a bit too high waisted for me. other than that  the dress is as it appears.
-1,From the photos  i thought the design was embroidered. in reality  it is stamped on. there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins  but overall  the design is just printed on the fabric. i didn't feel it looked good  in fact it looked kind of cheap to me  so i returned it. the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual. i was disappointed it didn't work out.
-1,I returned this item. it was soft. very blah fabric. nothing special.
0,I was so excited to find this dress in the store! i immediately headed for the dressing room to try this beauty on....what a disappointment. the fabric is stunning  but the fit is extremely voluminous . i am normally a small to medium  so i grabbed a small......the only way to describe this dress is tentlike!  it was huge from the waist down. i don't think i could size to an xs because i am a 34d and the top half of the dress fit perfect!  i was sad to leave the store without this dress.
1,This shirt is nothing like the online pictures. it's a stunner in person. ended up with the black one though i was torn between it and the white. i would agree with some other reviewers that it has little to no give across the chest so i bought a l due to broad shoulders. the m fit like a glove and i was afraid it might tear if i raised arms or reached for something. not sure if a large busted girl would be comfortable. though i sized up  it didn't affect the way it hangs and it hangs beautifull
1,Beautiful in person! highly recommend: great quality  beautiful design  flattering!
1,This dress is so soft and cozy and pretty.  love the shine and interesting sheen whenever you move.  very comfortable and looks great with a variety of layers. i want to buy more colors but right now i just have the mauve. ordered size m and i'm 38-27-35 #135.
0,"I really wanted to love this. sadly  the first thing i noticed was how tight it was in the arms and across the back (size up maybe even two sizes). secondly  it's see through! a top like this looses it's finesse to me once i can see my pant line and bra. it's very difficult to do the three buttons in the back yourself and finally  good luck taking it off without getting make up all over the neckline. someone dubbed it the ""poor man's pineapple top."" i couldn't agree more  sigh. i really did want"
0,This shirt is beautiful and so soft. it would have made a wonderful long-sleeved tee except for the fact that it was so low cut. the only way this is wearable is with a tank underneath which  for me  defeats the purpose of this type of shirt. i am rather busty (34 dd)  so maybe if you are smaller on top you might could pull it off.
