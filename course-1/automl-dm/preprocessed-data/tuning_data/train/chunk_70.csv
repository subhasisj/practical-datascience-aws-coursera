0,This shirt is gorgeous at first glance. the quality is there and it has a beautiful design...from the front  that is. but it is huge and billowy with back pleats. i cannot imagine this being flattering on anyone. it just adds so much volume to the top. i am thin and petite so maybe that was the issue  but i just can't see adding so much volume. this was a total miss for me. such a shame. would have been great without all the extra volume in back.
1,I ordered this top in a xs which is what i usually wear in most tops. a little big but just shrunk it. very comfy and love the color.
-1,I ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints. while it appears to be made with quality  it runs really large. also  in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy. the actual fabric is just flat cotton. it's a very casual dress  not as dressy as pictured. it's also quite shapeless on. i'm returning it.
1,Nice top; the material is soft and drapey. i like to wear it layered under a shorter shirt or jacket.
0,"I have to say being a silk lover  decision was hard to make. the quality is phenomenal. i do agree to a reviewer that said it's pj like. i tried it with belt  didn't help much with the look somehow. it just felt empty. my daughter who i usually turn for opinions said ""ewww  grandma""... i know  truth hurts.    i can't exchange for a smaller size either because the fabric is not stretchy and i'm afraid the extra small would confine my arm movement. on top of that  the background is more peachy tha"
-1,I wanted so badly to love this dress  but i couldn't get past the thin material that you can actually see through. not for this price anyhow. the dress is shorter than i had anticipated  and more fitted around the waistline flaring out at the bottom which i feel isn't accurately portrayed in the photo. on the positive though  the color is beautiful and the neck line stunning  but alas will be returning.
0,These pants are adorable as pajamas or maybe something very casual to wear to the beach  but they honestly do not seem like something that a grown woman would wear in public. they are good quality and fit nicely  but i feel like if you're over 20  they're not really flattering or especially appropriate.
0,"The fit is definitely more ""straight-leg "" and not skinny  as the photos seem to imply. at 4'11"" and 95 lbs  the size 25 fit my waist and butt wonderfully  and the length was great  but the jean lost shape at the knee. i would recommend these jeans if you are not seeking a skinny fit!"
0,I was disappointed in this bordeaux top  a brand i usually enjoy. i ordered a medium  my usual size in their tops. it was very very big and did not fit at all as pictured here. also  the fabric is somewhat sheer and while i tried it on wearing a darker bra  the combo of being way too large and a bit sheer was enough for me to return it.
1,"I like this sweater so much i just bought it in a second color! the pleats make the sweater conform to my shape just enough to be flattering. i wore it over three different dresses this week that might have felt too bare for work or cooler weather. i live in a hot climate so this is the right weight for our cooler months. the metallic threads give it a little bit of flair and the grey color goes with everything. i'm 5'7"" size 10-12 and the large fit just right."
1,The color is a very soft peach  and the knit top over the gauze is a very light  summer-weight knit. i can see this being worn casual  or dressed up with a statement necklace and nice skirt / pants.
-1,This dress is so cute but it's going back. the zipper is horrible and all of the other reviews are true - you'll need to size up.
-1,I wanted to love this. however  the fit was funky and the colors were muted. this is definitely something you must try on in the store. too risky to buy online due to weird fit.
0,I ordered the navy/gray combo in size xl. it was too heavy and uncomfortable to wear. it also attracted so much lint. the one i received must have come from a store because it already had a lot of fuzz on it. it added weight and was unflattering for my shape. the colors do match the photos online. the length also matches the model's photos. it just didn't work for me.
-1,I ordered this top because it was 100 percent cotton and a cute design. when it arrived  i thought it was a cute  different top  uniquely designed. when i tried it on  it looked like a had several extra rolls due to the ruching and was very unflattering. it reminded me of the michelin man wearing extra tires and i am of a thin build so i did not like the perception of rolls throughout the bodice. unfortunately  it did not work for me. i wish retailer would include more cotton tops in their collect
0,This top is a little more casual than i anticipated especially for the price. it is completely sheer and you do need a tank under it. also  the arm and neck makes it look more like a ordinary teeshirt. still  the lace design is super cute and would work well with both skirts and jeans.
0,I was excited to see this top in person  but once i got a close up look at it (and also tried it on) i was disappointed. first  the color is much more persimmon orangey in person and that's a hard color to pull off for a lot of people. it just pulls any pink or red in your skin and highlights it.     second  the top was poorly finished. i had to pick up two to try on because the lace was wonky across the front of the first one i grabbed. so much so that the lace was puckered because it had been
0,I loved this when i saw it arrive in the mail. as soon as i put it on though  i was drowning in it. i know its a cape and it is suppose to be large but it was so big i had to return it. i still really like it and wish it would have worked. i am 5'5  athletic/slim figure just for reference.
-1,Very disappointed: runs small in chest and too long. the fabric is cheap but the print is pretty with the bead and flower detail. i don't think  this dress is worth the price  it is not even silk and the underlay feels like cheap gauze. i have been in the fashion industry for over 30 years and this is a miss mark in my opinion. put it back on the rack  and save your $ for something better at sweet retailer!
0,"I read the reviews before i bought this dress and had trouble believing that the dress literally fell apart at the seams so i bought it. first the good: i love the color  the fabric  and the design. it's very lightweight and loose-fitting and is perfect for hot days. the neck and sleeves are pretty on. i can wear it as a cover up or put on a necklace and sandals for everyday errands and things.  now the bad: it literally falls apart at the seams as you take it out of the package! i""m surprised a"
-1,This dress is not flattering. the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy. like the other reviewer said  its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through. it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it didn't help regardless. the length is not accurate either. i would say it's a pretty short dress (mid thigh) but that probably depends on the person. it also makes you look very horizontal. i was really excited about this dress but it's getting r
1,This vest kept catching my eye online. i was ordering moth cashmere cowlneck sweater  (which is fabulous ) when i noticed pictures posted of women wearing both the vest & sweater. the more i looked at these pictures  the more i fell in love with the vest. needless to say  i purchased the vest in my usual size xs which fits tts. it's incredibly soft & a great piece to add to your wardrobe!
0,I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly. i am anywhere from a size 6-8. 5'9  155lbs.  sadly  i am returning this dress because the horizontal stripes make my hips look huge.
-1,If you're pregnant  congratulations. this shirt is for you. if you've ever dreamed of being an xxs  this shirt is also for you. i'm a 34d  normally a small or medium  but often size down to xs in swing tops. the xs is ginormous on me  although it fits through the shoulders. i can hold onto the bottom and stretch my arms straight out at the sides  it's that wide. think flying squirrel. what doesn't show in the pictures is that it also has a slight dolman sleeve  which makes it look wide at the to
-1,Really unattractive shirt. nothing good i can say about it. horrible fit. i can't imagine this would look good on anyone.
0,I love this!!!! nice and lightweight. super stylish
1,I absolutely love this sweater. it's super soft and the grey/white version is lovely. it's definitely more cropped (i'm 5'7)  but looks great with high waisted jeans or a pencil skirt.     so cozy!
0,Love the design and style of this dress when i saw it online  however  it falls a little short once in person. it was a bit boxier than i wanted and the lines didn't make it appear as a swing dress  highlighting your figure.  i wish this could have worked  however  it felt a little too unshapely.
0,Beautiful - ordered a s  i wear a 2 in most retailer items. hand washed in cold water  shrunk inches  yes inches! love maeve clothing  this shirt is gorgeous. before hand washing in the sink  it was large and flowy. now it barely fits.
1,Love this! fits great. warm and soft. would recommend
1,These tights are exactly what i was looking for! they are a great weight for the winter months and can be worn out/dressed up or for lounging around at the house. they are a nice weight and durable construction. i plan to pair them with skirts  tunics and dresses. they are super cute with ankle boots.
0,"This is a thick jacquard fabric and the colors are stunning. this would be best for very thin petties or tall women. i'm 5'4""  125#  27/4  and it was just too much fabric so my waist looked thick. the length was great though. sad it didn't work out"
-1,I love the teal color of this t-shirt and the macrame design at the top is beautiful  however  the top is way too large.  i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops  so i ordered the size s  there is so much fabric below the chest it fits like a maternity top.  i know if i order an xs  i will have the same problem.  below the bust  the top is not flattering and it&amp;#39;s a shame.
1,I like these pants. they fit nice but they are sheer which is not a problem for me. my only issue was that the print is not symmetrical as shown in the picture. the print is what drew me to these pants. the pattern is all over the place in the ones i received. they are nice so i will keep them at the sale price but i don't think they would be worth it at full price.
-1,I wanted to love this so much that i ordered in both a mp and sp. both have gone back. i'm petite and curvy - particularly on top. i wear petites 90% of the time. this didn't fit like a petite - it was cut like full size in every way - particularly the arm holes and length. when the mp didn't fit (i always start trying on in the larger size)  i thought - well surely the small will be better. i considered keeping because i would wear it with jackets over it  then decided that was crazy. disappoin
-1,I've purchased pilcro jeans in the past and they've held up great. unfortunately  the material used for this particular jean is a far  far cry from what it used to be. the thighs of these jeans start pilling (yes pilling!) after just a few wears. i've never had jeans do this -- whatever denim blend they are using is a complete disaster.    don't buy these -- you will be very disappointed.
1,This dress stunning for the hourglass figure. the hips may be a little narrow. i bought the 6p and 4p and the 4p fit best. i read some reviews that said the hips were snug. it's true- a little difficult to sit down haha but the dress is so flattering. shoulders are a little loose  and i have pretty broad shoulders and a full chest. i'm 5'4  32dd  waist 27 and 130 lbs.
-1,I am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards. this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago! poor quality in cut  fabric  design. this is a top one would grab at a local box store for 19.99. the colors are not as vibrant. the shoulders ill fitted. and the fabric and threads are very cheap. i was expecting so much more.sorry retailer.....my favorite store to shop!
1,"This dress is great but extremely short. i'm 5'6"" wear a size 4/6. the 6 looked like a tunic on me it was so short."
1,"I hate buying dresses because i rarely find one that fits well. i'm very petite on top (xsmall) and small/med on bottom  5'8"". usually dresses are tight on my hips & thighs and loose up top. this fairly lightweight yet warm dress is such a winner! form-fitting yet stretchy and forgiving in all the right places. the x-small and small both fit pretty well but i decided to go with the x-small on this one. i think this will be a staple winter/fall dress. loved the fit so much i bought it in the peac"
-1,The blouse is lovely - but after washing it exactly as specified  it shrank more than a full size. this is an expensive hand-me-down for my daughter...
1,These joggers are gorgeous--you can even dress them up! the quality and softness is amazing and very expensive looking. the fit is perfect not to mention the fact that they are very flattering. really  i knew the minute i saw them  i would love them. but  i do have to say that the lovely model wearing them ---the model with the wine colored shirt and the awesome red bag (i bought that too!!!)and that big smile sold me!. many thanks to retailer--personal stylists carolyn and blair. always so helpfu
-1,I'm worried about the quality of the shirt. it looks like it may snag easily. i've decided to keep it  so hopefully i will get some use out of it. in hindsight i would have not bought it when considering the price and quality of the shirt.
0,I was so excited about this top  super cute and fit perfectly but as soon as i washed it (cold  hand wash  air dry) it shrunk! now it is too short and tight. i did not expect the material to shrink so very disappointed.
-1,"Dress is nice but can't be worn without tights or you are at a risk of indecently exposing yourself. it is around 30"" in length so is more of a tunic than a dress. i'm only 5'1 and it was too short . can't imagine anyone taller even trying to wear this !"
1,Cute layered cami. great colors for summer or fall. very light fabric  tends to get a bit staticy. shorter in the back than expected but a good versatile top
1,These pants are really cute but definitely run small - i ordered a large so they would be a little bigger for lounging and they are not very stretchy. the large fits more like a small in regular sweatpants. there is more blue visible in the top and bottom part of the pants as well  which i like.
-1,Perhaps i should have gotten two sizes smaller  but the knees on these were baggie by lunch.  they are very soft and comfortable  but i wouldn't buy them again.
-1,"This sweater was a big let down. i am 5'2"" so i ordered it in a petite. it was so short that if i lifted my arms  you'd see my bra!! there is no way i could wear it without something under it- even with high waisted bottoms. and the bell sleeves look nothing like the pic. the entire sleeve is just wide  and it continues with little increase into the cuff. it is just short and boxy. it is going back for sure."
0,"I like the feel and color of this blouse. however  i was very disappointed with the sizing. i usually wear medium so i ordered medium for this blouse  it fits way too big. it is a bummer because the ""curve"" is not even visible when i wear it."
1,Love it! perfect casual look with a jacket and booties
1,This is a charming dress  with lots of quality touches  and something which is easy to wear and appropriate for many occasions. however  the dress i received wasn't quite like the dress pictured in the catalog and main website photos. the bottom buttons of the over-dress do not have matching holes  so you can't button it. this makes the v lower  and the bodice looser. it is like the photo with the brunette model on the website  rather than the primary photos with the blonde lady. personally  i w
-1,Material is so thin this shirt ripped in three places after wearing only once.    got a size larger than i needed as i have a larger chest and even though it's a bit lose the thread has ripped material on my chest and in the armpits.
1,Gorgeous linen blend tee. purchased in grey and white. classic timeless staples. fits baggy which i love. for reference i am 32a 5'1 105 lbs. love love love!
-1,I love the fit of these pants -- they're the perfect slim black pants. however  i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one  but multiple places. disappointed by the workmanship/quality of the product  especially since the pants fit amazingly and don't sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do. i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product.
1,First i found the picture of this blouse stunning because the colors caught my attention . with that said  i found myself thinking of all the many events this could worn to  dressed up or down. so.... i found myself ordering it asap  paranoid that others were thinking i was thinking the same thing. well   i received it in the mail   and it was better than i thought!!! the colors and cut of this blouse is just as in the picture. i personally love this article/pattern of art  as i see it as an exp
0,I was so excited to purchase this dress for my masters graduation party. it looks beautiful on but i could not get over one little detail. the structure of the top falls funny on your chest - a bit too high from the rest of the pulled fabric. it doesn't look right. if you have a necklace that falls perfectly on the piece of fabric  like the main photo shown  you are good. the third photo with the short necklace shows this issue best.
-1,I bought this dress online and was hoping it would be a great comfortable staple.. it may be the most unflattering piece of clothing i have ever tried on ever! i let my sisters try it on too  to see if they wanted it or liked it better  but it was awful on them as well. i ordered the xs in blue. it was beyond enormous and was just plain and unflattering. i am 5'7' and 115. i love swing dresses i just don't think is cut well.
0,I love the look of this dress and the material - the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off. it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear. i don't think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work. it is a shame because i really liked the look of it.
0,Absolutely love these pants! i have had these pilcos for about two months now and it has been a staple in my fall wardrobe. i have worn them at least once a week. the only downfall is the button has already fallen off and the seam in the knee has recently torn apart. given the leather  i'm not sure if they can be fixed. these are fabulous  but the quality is just not there. very disappointing.
1,"These jeans are worth every penny! they fit me perfectly as soon as i put them on  and i wore them the rest of the day! they are true to size with very generous stretch...if anything  i would size down. they feel durable  but not like typical denim. very soft. i am 5'3"" and about 117 or so  and my normal 25 fit like a dream. i did end up exchanging these because there was a small nick on the inside of the left thigh  and i was afraid they might tear right open. if the new pair comes without defe"
0,This dress could have been great but for me there was too much design on the top part/ front. i wish the neckline was different or just less beadwork/ design near my face.  all in all its a maxi dress and was returned because approx. $250 was too much to spend on this.
-1,I wanted to like this so much. it's a great good girl dress  church dress. however  it makes no sense. it's a summer dress with massively thick lining that snags i'm petite and busty and it made me look and feel very wide.
1,This cape is stunning! the perfect addition to any closet. it can be worn to a formal or out to dinner with jeans. the fur is so soft and the quality is superior. it has real fur hooks (four) to close it and the side pockets are adorable. definitely a buy and a bargain on sale!
-1,This dress is adorable in the photo; however  in reality  it fits like a tent. the top would be okay although i would need a smaller size if i were to keep it. it flares out in the skirt to become an a-line and it's just not very flattering. if i had read the reviews before ordering  i would have sized down  but i ordered before any reviews had been posted. sadly  i must return.
1,"I tried this dress on in the store.  i wear either a s or xs in retailer clothes.  its loose fitting  so i went with the xs.  the arm holes were tight  but have very cute buttons if you look closely at the picture.  you can also roll the sleeves up and there is a coordinating plaid underneath  which adds a nice touch.  great length  not too short or too long.  the grey color is much prettier in person.  i felt it had a little more of a blue tint. for reference i am 5'6""  124 lbs  and 32b."
0,I found both colors and jumped on this shirt. then i got it home and realized that it was pretty much useless. there is no way to put a sweater or jacket over it  it is too hot to wear in the summer  putting a tee under ruins the look.  i am very flat chested so it hung well  but there is lots of shirt. both went back in exchange for two wearable items.
0,I have a 36c bust. i bought this blouse in a 10  even though i wear an 8 or 10. i sized up based on previous reviews. this top was super tight in the bust (it literally flattened my breasts) and very loose on the bottom. it was not flattering at all. the material is gorgeous. it is thick. it is lined. it is darted at the bust and it flares out in a peplum fashion where the light fabric up top meets the dark band of fabric in the middle. the problem is that busty ladies will find the bust area wa
1,"Not what i was expecting  but pleasantly surprised.  was envisioning a more structured/tailored trouser  but these are closer to leggings  albeit very substantial ones with ""real pant"" touches like a zip/button front and (faux) pockets.  they're form fitting  soft yet supportive  stretchy  incredibly comfortable  and tts.  i'm a pretty legit 10 in pants (30/31)  and the 10's near perfect  with the rise coming right to my belly button.  think i'll grab another pair now while they're available."
1,I love this top soooooo much! i love straps and i love tops that will show some of my sports bra in the back  since i tend to buy some that have some strappiness. i love that this top has it all-it is lightweight  and it has some character so it is more attractive than an everyday kind of workout top. it is comfortable  even for classes like body pump where you are constantly moving your arms. i love that the colors are not bold  i am sick of neon!!!!
0,Bought this in the store and fell in love with it. very soft and flattering to wear. however  after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill. this truly is a beautiful sweater  but i fear it will not be beautiful for long. i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale.
-1,Loved the sweater and the sale price was great  but i could not take the shedding! even after just trying it on the first time  my jeans and top had shedding all over them. this was 2 minutes  i could not imagine what i would look like if i wore it all day. had to return.
