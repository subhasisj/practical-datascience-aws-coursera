-1,I wear med or large in most items. the medium was huge. fit like a moo moo. size down by at least two.
1,"I absolutely love this cardigan! it is so soft and goes with anything. it can be dressed up or down. it is definitely my new ""go to"" for airplane travels. highly recommend!!"
-1,The tank looks nothing like the one pictured  mainly because it's tissue-paper thin. also  i ordered it in two sizes - xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit. i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large. the armholes hit halfway to my waist. obviously i didn't even bother opening the size s. both will be returned.
0,The dress has a flattering cut and is a nice color. but  the fabric looks like old  matted carpet. i will be returning.
1,Love love the print on these but the fit is off. i tried on the solid color in this same style and i took my regular size 30. these i needed a 12. the waist seems really small but the bottom leg parts stretch out and are kind of baggy after 1 wear. i can't go down a size because the waist was too small on the 10. since i love the print so much it may be tolerable. rare for hei hei to fit wonky.
0,I adore a good vest  so when i saw this one at my retailer i had to try it on immediately. i don't wear cream often  but the design and weight of this vest is dreamy. i tried it on at the store and i was on the fence. so i bought it  took it home and tried it on with everything. i am a curvy girl  and i wasn't thrilled with how this fit. now its part of the retailer athleisure line  and i could definitely see this being worn post workout with cute workout gear. girls who are tall and thin  or even w
-1,Beautiful dress  but has an unflattering fit. i purchased an xs and it's past my knees and the bottom of the dress is so heavy! would be a perfect maternity dress though!
0,I really like the dress  the material  the print and the pleated skirt are totally fun. however  the neckline is a bit to low  and a cami is necessary  at least for me. the material is very sheer  which will be noted on the sleeves and the lower skirt where the liner falls short ( about 4 inches above the knee).the main draw back i personally have with this dress is taking it off. there are no zippers or buttons. getting it on is easy  not so when taking it off!
-1,Bought this shirt on sale. it was super cute in the dressing room  and for the first time i wore it. washed it per the instructions (wash delicate with cold water  lay flat to dry) and it shrunk so much i don't think i'm going to be able to wear it anymore. it was oversized and loose when i bought it  so it shrunk a lot. there is also a small hole all of the sudden  that i have no idea where it came from (wasn't there when i put it in the washer). very disappointed.
-1,I loved this shirt until the first time i washed it. it shrunk so much it became unwearable. when i returned it the salesperson said she had also bought this shirt and the same thing happened.
1,I bought this dress in store today in a size 4  i usually wear an 8 (so i was thrilled) the print and details are gorgeous but it's a very wide swing dress  there is a lot of fabric and it has no waist. i'm going to wear this with a belt so it's fine but the images online are a little misleading.
-1,I wanted to love this top. but  it looks like an ambitious 12 year old made it with rumpled fabric and lace found in her grandmothers attic. re: hopeful  but not good. the quality is not good and it hangs strangely on. sadly it is going back.
1,This is my favorite top! it is gorgeous  soft  & oh so comfortable. it's not too tight & works with leggings  jeans  or as an over-shirt. love it!
-1,The length in the front is too short and the bottom flares a lot which is really unflattering. i love the top half of the shirt but the bottom half should be more form fitting.
1,"I ordered this dress for a special event and i am so incredibly happy with it! i am 5'1""  97 lbs  32b and ordered a 0 petite. fits like a glove. the dress has a slight give to it  but main dress fabric is a thick material so order your usual size. fits close through the waist and flares out below. the length hit above the knee so not too short  although i wouldn't want it any shorter. my main worry was whether my bra would show in the back  but i had no issue. overall  the dress is stunning with"
1,This is a beautiful top  but it runs large.  i am exchanging for one size smaller.  it is worth the effort of exchanging!  well made  beautiful lace.
-1,I ordered a size 12 and it was huge on me! very loose fitting dress. i didn't like the material either.
0,Loved the pattern and colors of this dress. the material was extremely heavy. the shoulders and across the back was very small so that i couldn't lift my arms or put them out straight in front of me. but then the rest of the dress was huge and shapeless. sadly i had to return it.
-1,I just received my back-ordered wildberry top in blue. it's not blue but instead a dull  mottled purplish hue. it looks like a well-worn  stretched out tee shirt with a tired ruffle along the bottom. so disappointing. it's going back for sure.
1,I saw this at a store today and am so glad i tried it on. i'm usually xs in retailer tops  but for this shirt i preferred s for a loose fit. the lace detail is elegant and very pretty.
-1,I was so excited to buy this coat  since i missed out on buying the last one. i snagged it quickly before heading out on a trip because this is the perfect plane jacket (i've borrowed my friends). i immediately noticed that the fabric was lighter and softer than the original  and after a few days noticed a lot of pilling on the coat  and a snag on the seam of the shoulder where the arm connects to the body. it's disappointing considering the price you pay. i would return if it still had tags on.
1,"These jeans not only fit well  i love the way the fabric feels. for denim the fabric feels soft on the skin. i am 5'8 and the inseam of 30 inches was perfect. they call them ""hi-rise""  but them seem more like a ""mid-rise"" to me which i prefer. i am going to buy another pair in a different wash."
0,I love these jeans  but they run small. i recommend ordering one size up.
-1,This is literally the most unflattering thing i have ever tried on from retailer. the sleeves are so weird and ugly. they get really fat at the top  like a dolman sleeve  but it looks really strange because they don?t flow into the rest of the top  which is very structured. it made my shoulders look huge even though i have very narrow shoulders. this is not apparent in the model picture at all. the thick black seams at the shoulders are also placed in a really awkward spot which also contri
0,I really like how this looks on the model  but in real life this top is much tighter. i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops. i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work  but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes. i returned it  a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her. so  best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips.
1,This top is sooo cute. it does not look like pajamas as one person said  it looks like a top. it's a bit on the boxy style  so anything you want to hide below is well covered. has a nice length to it. is not just for lounging. paired it with a black pencil skirt and it looked great. i ordered the xl (i am a 40d for reference) and it hung very nicely. its extremely soft and very comfy. i only wish they had more colors.
1,This dress is just absolutely adorable! you can dress it up and wear it to a wedding  or you can dress it down and slip on a pair of sandals and use it as a casual summer dress! this dress does run a tad bit large - i'm usually a size 4 but the size 4 was slightly too big for me. best purchase yet!
-1,I ordered a size smaller prr other reviewers but that still didn't prepare me for the sweater's issues. it looks really cute but the quality is pretty horrendous. i wore it for the first time today and already the sweater is pilling a lot on my back. seriously heartbroken.
0,This shirt is cute. i like the pleated neck as it makes the top feminine  while still casual. it is made of very soft fabric and drapes nicely. the only issue is that the seam/pleat that runs down the middle is off center. i think the fabric was cut incorrectly so the seam twists to one side after i have it on for a few minutes and move around. i keep having to twist it straight which is very annoying.
1,"The print  layers and fit of this dress remind me of the 1990's but in a good way! the outer dress is voluminous and flowy  so i understand why some reviewers feel the dress runs large. the embroidered slip is tts and quite the cherry on top. i really appreciate that styling detail. 140# 36dd 5'3"" and i chose medium regular length  not petite since i'm older and wanted the length."
1,"Love this top.  i get compliments every time i wear it.  got the medium. fits perfect. 5'4""  138#.  even at my age it looks great."
0,Online this top looks fabulous  but in person  not so great. great color  nice quality for a lightweight top  but when i tried it on  the neck does not lay nicely. too much sloppy wrinkled material just hanging awkwardly around the neck ( and i love cowl neck). i found  for me  it dipped very low showing cleavage and i have a large chest  so didn't work. for reference  i'm 5'4 118 and usually wear a small in retailer tops because it seems the majority of their clothes run large. i purchased a smal
0,I have a love/hate relationship with these jeans. when i first put them on  i felt like i had finally found my favorite pair of jeans. everything about how they fit and looked was just perfect - and they were offered in a petite size! but then two hours later they were sagging. the fabric is so cozy  but it just stretches too much  too fast. i am not willing to give up yet  so i ordered another pair in a smaller size. i'm less than thrilled about having to shell out the $$ for two pairs  but i r
0,I love the fabric and pattern of this dress so much that i decided to keep it (got it on mega sale)  but i would have never paid full price or anything close. the armholes are enormous  showing bra and all. i am not particularly large chested (34c)  and the buttons are stretched to gaping on me  even with the huge armholes. i have a cute red sweater coat that i will wear over it all fall  but i could not recommend it because of the poor cut design.  pros: great pattern  fabric  pockets  true to
1,Like the idea but the tee was was very boxy. i tried the size small and it fit at the shoulders but the body was very big. i would say they pinned it for the product photo:)  i'm 34a...usually a size small. it was soft and fun but a no for me at this price.
-1,First  it's huge. i'm not big busted but it's so roomy that i looked like i was pregnant. not exactly what i was going for. nice color and soft fabric but would only work if you plan to tuck it in--and i'm short waisted so no tucking for me. back it went.
-1,The fabric is a little stiff  the back looks unusually long compared to the front  and it fits tight across the chest. and i'm not busty so that's not a factor.
0,The detail on this top is beautiful  love the embroidery ! i wanted it to work so bad  but it is much too wide  bells out and makes my size 8/10 body look wider than it is  another reviewer mentioned the model must have it pinned on the sides  because the top does not lay like that. it runs large  especially under the arms. too bad......
1,Very nice polka-dot pattern. i so think it is versatile and can go with a lot of different colors. i am worn it was different colors underneath and both a skirt and jeans. it is a timeless classic!!
0,So  disappointed that no where in the limiting did it mention this suit is australian in size!! i ordered the 10 (i'm usually an 8 but that was sold out) and the suit arrives and doesn't even fir over my hips. -- the label clearly says 10 australian us 6!  gutted that i have to return this suit because of this sizing issue.  the suit looks to be well made and the design is adorable of it only for.
-1,Large and the material is too bulky. i returned it.
1,"This dress is so gorgeous! it fits perfectly  is stretchy  wonderful  comfortable  and the fabric is nice and thick with beautiful texture. i absolutely love it! i'm 5'6""  125 lbs  with a pretty athletic build  and it fits like a dream! i love the color  the fabric  the fit  the stretch  the comfort  the sexyness of it..... it's my new favorite! highly recommended!"
1,I just couldn't resist this dress! it's blue  it's fun  it's feminine. the color is so vivid and beautiful in person. i was worried that the length would be an issue (i bought a regular size instead of my normal petite)  but i feel that it is perfect. it fits great  and i know i will wear it a lot this summer.
0,I thought this tank would be so cute and comfy for my daily walks  but it's completely see through.  i sized down one size based on a review from another website and it fits ok  but it's hard to say if it runs tts because i have nothing to compare it to.  if the fabric was a little thicker  this would be the perfect tank.  unless your planning on layering this  i wouldn't recommend.
0,I wear a 32 and sometimes a 31 but i could barely squeeze these on in a 32. the fabric is thick with lots of stretch but these are super skinny all the way to the ankle like a legging and not a jean. made for much thinner frames than mine.
1,Sized up due to my 36ddd breastfeeding bust and the 14 for perfectly.  i am 5'6 and 165lbs  just fyi.  dress is super flattering on my post 4-baby body.  it's very slimming.  looking forward to wearing to a casual wedding 
1,"These ""jeans"" definitely look more like pants and are very snug  but stretchy. i'm 5'10 and ordered the tall  and mine are a little longer than shown on the model. they look nice on  but are a tad tighter than i anticipated."
0,I loved how the skirt looked on the model  but when i tried in on it had no shape on me. i usually wear a size 6 and received a size 4 which was large on me. also  the material feels rough which i was not expecting as it is advertised as a silk skirt. i was really looking forward to wearing this skirt but it is just not i thought it was - i expect better quality from retailer.
0,This is a beautiful looking dress  but definitely runs wide and long. i'm 5'4  112llbs and my normal xs swallowed me up. if it had been available in xs petite then that probably would have worked  even though i normally never go with petites. it is a gorgeous dress  and would probably work on those ladies who are taller.
-1,I had high hopes for this tunic for an upcoming ny trip - to look stylish and beat the heat. it is huge. the tunic swallowed my whole. it came down nearly to my knees (i'm 5' 6) and it was gigantic - shapeless and did not look stylish at all. on the model it looks like it hits mid-thigh. i am a size 10 - and the l was like a giant trash bag on me. if i had time  i would try the medium ...
-1,This dress was a disappointment. not black  but brown. and it was very oddly made  with a weird  seam right across the belly. on its way back...
-1,I own 4-5 other cloth and stone tops and always love the softness of the material. this one missed the mark. not soft and very thick. not what i was expecting.
0,"I love ag jeans. i own several pair  and i think they wash well  and wear well. that being said  i'd never purchased a pair of the ""stevie"" cut before. they have the same quality one would expect from ag  and i like that the ankles aren't true skinny jeans  but have a little width. it's more on-trend for this season. for me  the issue was more with the color. i order pink. when they arrived  they were beautiful in the little plastic bag. my heart skipped a beat. hooray! cute new jeans! except  w"
1,A fun  casual romper. i loved the pink color (not usually my thing)  which looks great with darker skin. like another reviewer said  the waist is quite small so i would recommend sizing up one or two sizes (i took a size 6 in this  but am usually a 2/4) - this will make the top part a bit blousy  but i think that adds to the appeal/ look.
0,"The fabric and color of this dress is beautiful. two problems with the dress that the picture does not show. 1. it's long. i'm 5'5"". this model must be over 6 feet tall as the length hit 5 inches above my ankle and that is not a flattering length. the other issue is that there is toile underneath making the skirt extra puffy. i'm 42 and the puffiness reminded me of prom. color and fabric great. but had to send back."
1,I disagree with the other reviewer - i thought the fabric of this skirt was high quality  and while it wasn't lined i don't think lining is typical in a sweater material. i also really liked the patter and the swingy bell shape. i usually wear a 6 or 8  but my store only had a 4 available. it fit  but was a little tight in the hips. the skirt was also longer on me then on the model  but i'm on the short side.
0,"I buy pretty much every tiny top retailer carries and so of course i grabbed this one online. i would say size wise it's consistent for tiny  which in my opinion is in the ""runs small"" category as i'm a large in basically every top ever except the tiiny brand where i always have to take an xl. anyway  the print is beautiful but the neckline is strange- there is a very flimsy button keeping it tacked shut at the very top  and if that snap pops open it's open all the way down to the waist area where"
-1,I ordered first the green  then the grey (in case the green was mismarked.)  so short!!  is this to be in keeping with the ankle pant trend??  anyone who wants a shorter pant could easily hem them. but there is no way to lengthen them.  i held the new pants up to an older pair from previous years. they are a full 2 1/2 inches shorter! wow!  note how in the photo of the golden color pants they barely skim the model's ankle. that's how they are in real life.  i wear these pants in a tall  and live
1,I love this slip.. i am contemplating whether i can pass it off as a dress over the summer. the skirt is a subtle shinier grey than the top. it is flattering with or without a bra and i am not usually the type to go without. i am 5'3  32c and the xs fits perfectly! also i think it looks better in person.
0,I like the fabric and aesthetic of this top  and really wanted to like it  however i wish it were longer. i am a size small or med in all retailer clothes  but even the medium felt short and clingy. however that might be because i'm curvy with a long torso  so i'd definitely recommend trying this on rather than buying online!
-1,"I bought this jacket based on how it looked on the model  and from the reviews. i found it to be super big  and unflattering to say the least. i'm 5""10  155lbs. i sent it back."
0,"I coveted this dress for so long  but this was a case of the photo giving me a different visual impression than seeing it in real life. the ""gold"" patterns on top aren't shiny and delicate in person as i had imagined  and they actually make a very strong impression up close (and are painted on  it seems). the mesh they lay on is also more coarse than i had hoped. the coolest part about this dress  though  is the shiny  sequined black underlay. the photo doesn't do that component justice. i was s"
0,Not good for for an hourglass shape. lots and lots of pretty fabric  but the waist hits just where the hips widen--very bohemian (just no good for a figure 8). the sizing is generous. with both elastic and a zipper  there's room to go small if between sizes  be aware: the plunge at the front is wide and dramatic. i dropped the hangar in the dressing room and had to clutch fabric close to my reasonably-modest c-cup so as not to spill out. would perhaps work on a very narrow person who's completel
-1,"I love the look of this dress on model but sadly  fit didn't work out. very short waisted and tight across chest with very ample arm holes. i'm 5'8""  155  34c  reliably a size 10. this dress seemed at least 2 sizes off for me. my daughter  usually a size 2  could wear it except for the arm hole size (and the fact that it's 158 dollars and she's 13....going back.) btw  ""novelty print"" means ""ice cream novelty""  little popsicles with bites taken out - cute but more juvenile than i expected."
-1,I ordered these twice just to be sure there wasn't a glitch. the color is so off! the picture shows a dark blue denim  but they are not they are a light blue - with whiskering! retailer you need to have a better image of the color because this is so misleading.
0,I ordered the skirt online and when it arrived i loved the fit and the aesthetic of the skirt. i usually wear a 0/2 bottoms and sized up based on comments- it fits great could maybe even have taken a 6 to have a looser fit.  i was however very disappointed when receiving the skirt to see that the material was already highly snagged- how is that possible if coming directly from the warehouse? i'm hesitating to return because i consider it already damaged based on the current condition and if it's
0,I love the cut and aesthetic of this shirt  but the fabric unfortunately shows even the slightest hint of sweat  which makes it difficult to wear without being self conscious
1,I love the oversized look of this jacket--my building is kept freezing cold so while at work i am constantly fiddling with cardigans and scarves and a space heater to try to keep from freezing while working and i thought this jacket would be a great jacket that basically functions as a blanket while still looking professional. (my boyfriend doesn't quite get the 3/4-length sleeves but that definitely keeps the look of this jacket polished--if they were longer i think it would be too much just li
-1,I thought this would be cute with leggings based upon the length on the model. i forget that the models are almost 6 feet tall. this has a polyester slip goes under it that snaps onto the shoulders. it came down to my knees and was completely like a sack no leggings and boots with this one. lovely material but not at all figure flattering.
-1,I wanted to love this dress. the cut  fit and color are adorable. unfortunately the fabric is super thin. due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the anti-static spray your mom used to use in the 80s. i was on the fence of keeping it  but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your panty-line the whole world will see it. i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue. i am most likely going to return it; even at 15% off  it is over-priced for the cheap
1,I received the pants and they are really nice. you can dress them up or down. i ordered a size 0 in regular and they did not fit me well around my thighs  as they were loose. i will have to return them as they do not have my size in petites. i am a size 0 in petites and ordered the size 0 in regular. the only downside to the pants was it was hard to undo the buttons and found it rather difficult.
1,Fits great and goes great under cardigans and jackets
