-1,I have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun. i really wanted to like it  but i could not. there were spots missing sequence  some fell off as i tried the dress on  and i did try it on twice. each time there were some on the floor. they are sewed on so poorly  for the price of this dress. i fear it would be a dress for one season and i'd have to throw it out. not for that price. so back it goes.
0,"The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical."
1,This dress is amazing! the photos do not do it justice! runs a tad large - definitely can size down.
-1,I really love the idea behind this. however  the fit doesn't work for me. i'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops  and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops. this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width. the neckline was very high (higher than it looks in the model photo) and the armholes were too big. so i don't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue. the other criticism is that the front is not lined.
-1,"I really didn't expect this sweater to be so short. i'm 5'8"" and there is no way it would fit me properly. i honestly didn't even try it on. i pulled it out of the bag and put it right back in and returned it. it looks like a crop top. i bought the blue  which was not as rich and nice looking in person as the picture. i love most things i buy through retailer but this was a swing and a miss."
1,Very sweet color   will go with everything . soft material . generously sized but cut is meant to be comfy .
0,This dress is gorgeous  but the cut of the neck and arms is designed for girls with a slim frame only. i wish it worked? the fabric and pattern are beautiful. sad to send it back.
0,"I coveted this item since i first saw it on instagram. i finally bought it in coral. it's a beautiful coat  the color is lovely and i like the way the hood makes a cute collar when worn down. the only problem is it looks like a bathrobe on me. i am 5'5"" and wear a size 8. i bought a medium  worried a small would not button. the sleeves are far too long. i do not want to go through the trouble of returning  so gave it to my daughter who is four inches taller. it looks cute in her."
-1,I feel that for this price  i should love this top (and i wanted to). however  the price is on the high side for a relatively basic top  and there were a few things about it that could be improved.  pros: i ordered a medium and feel that it's pretty true to size. additionally  the fabric is nice and light (but also *sheer*) and  generally speaking  has a nice pattern. overall  it's a very pretty top.  cons: there's a cute criss-cross ruffle thing happening in the back but the model has cleverly
1,I love this shirt for its subdued colors and casual style. it is lighter in weight than a flannel shirt but retains a feeling of softness. it is from cloth and stone  a brand i like. usually i buy that brand in a small because their shirts run large for me. i liked this shirt so much i ordered it twice and waited for a backorder. i sent the small size back and was lucky enough to get a medium before the next out of stock situation.
-1,I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it's true to size  it looks pretty baggy on. also  i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i'm returning this item.
0,The stylist had me try this top on off the shoulders  but that was kind of snug  perhaps why it didn't fit right  it is not off the shoulders on this picture. the cut is loose  so it looked big on me  but going smaller would not have worked the way i had it on... may give it another try on. xs was big  so would need to try the xxs next time. but off the shoulders looked nice on the lady who was smaller built next to me!    colors are nice  light  but appropriate for fall (or summer!) light fabri
1,Byron lars knows how to make you look like a woman with his magical dresses!  i decided to get the navy (i also own the sold-out marguerite aka carissima in bronze) instead of the black or white since everyone and their mother owns it already.  the lace of the top is different--more delicate but less intricate.  it's still very beautiful.    my body type is inverted and the dress is hourglass  so the size 8p fits great on top but loose on my hips and rear.  i'm going to keep this dress and do mo
0,"This tee was meant to be loose and swishy  but as it runs large  sizing down means the sides come up really high  as they curve a good 3-4"" higher up. so your waistband is exposed  and it just doesn't look nice:( returned an xs and small."
-1,The jeans look so different online! the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut. the rise is not as stated and is actually 10.5 inches! also  i'm a true 25 and the waist is like a 27  but the legs are super skinny. i'm so disappointed and i'm not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size. these look more like men's cut jeans.
-1,I was disappointed in this shirt. the color was not the pretty blue pictured  but rather a grayish blue which may look good on a brunette  but not on a blonde. the fabric felt like linen and wrinkled easily. normally  the quality of the fabric is one of my main reasons to buy holding horses  but this one felt cheap. the detail and craftsmanship was beautiful  and i wish this shirt would have worked for me. i waited for it to go on sale and was very excited to receive it. holding horses is one of
1,Fits a bit on the bigger side  but also being the style of the top. i would order down a bit. i'm usually a 4 on top( 34c) and the xs was perfect. the wine color is classy. it's a timeless piece...
1,"For the last two years  i have only purchased clothing for myself if it is secondhand  but then i saw this skirt and succumbed to temptation. first of all  the print is gorgeous! i'm a sucker for blue and white anything so it wasn't that hard of a sell. as other reviewers have mentioned  the seams line up! this kind of quality is so hard to find in clothing items anymore and really makes the skirt seem much more pricey than it really is (if you're buying it on sale like i did). i'm 5'3"" and will"
0,I tried this on in the store in the xs size. the pattern is striking and really makes you think of all the things you love about fall. having said that i did not buy it and probably won't unless i find it on the sale rack later. it is really more of a poncho than a sweater. the fit is very oversize through the body and i tried the xs size. it is also fairly cropped on me as i am tall. i would only wear it with a shirt underneath. the sleeves and not attached to the shoulder  but start further do
0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.
0,Just be prepared: this is huge! i looked hilarious in my normal 00p. this was in store  luckily  the the excellent personal stylist warned me. i also don't think the colors are as good in person - bit dull. if it fits you  it could be nice.
-1,I waited a long time to get this top. unfortunately i will be returning. the sides are gathered and stick out a lot on the sides. not as pictured. the sides should have been pleated. it runs smaller in the bust and when closed it was a little snug. afraid this might shrink with dry cleaning or washing. the design is unique and wish this top would of worked.
1,I have this in another color and it is my absolute fav! transform any outfit! it has an over-sized fit.
1,This is a great tunic for those of us who like to wear leggings as pants once in a while  it covers all the important parts without being too baggy. i found the fabric to be light and comfortable  but heavy enough that a light colored bra can't be seen underneath with it great if you don't feel like wearing multiple layers.
-1,The material is very nice. not flimsy at all which is nice. the problem was the fit around the arms. i am a petite person with a small chest but it still didn't cover me bra. i'll be returning it.
1,The pictures online do not do this justice. i did not even recognize it as the same dress at first. i went a size down and that way it flatters my curves beautifully instead of looking like a robe. it can actually be worn 3 ways- i like closing the closest snap(there's two) in the middle with a skinny belt over it  and a slip dress underneath. this way  the dress has a deep v neck and opens out in front when walking. think 1940's glam. it can also be fully closed like in the picture  or left ope
0,Oh wow no. as the previous reviewer said  much lighter than the picture! rise and inseam are as described but with the light denim they combined to make a bad look for this 40something. maybe for a younger audience who like the 90s retro vibe? the fit is true to size  i tried the 27 and it was a nice snug fit around the bum (waist 28/29  hips 36  usually a 27 or 28 in jeans  sometimes even a 29 if they're super skinny).
-1,This is an absolutely beautiful dress  but arrived with several holes in it!
-1,These pants look nice and are comfortable but the quality of the fabric is terrible! i should not be surprised because i bought another pair of pants by this same label at antro earlier this year and they did not hold up at all either. but i thought i'd give it another shot. never again! i'm on my 5th wear and the crotch and inner thighs have worn away completely...i mean huge holes in the fabric where it's just disintegrated. even at extra % off the sale price it's not worth it. the full price
1,"Perfect light weght sweater for the holidays. i love the detail in the back. the xs was a great fit for this 5'2""  115 lb body."
0,I ordered this item when it was first advertised  fell in love with the unique pattern in the top and could hardly wait for it to get here. however when i received the top i was very disappointed  the fabric is cheap  the sleeves are tight and the overall product is of poor quality and poorly constructed. needless to say i returned it.
-1,Disappointed  the cut of the layer makes anyone wearing it look pregnant. even the model in the picture the way that layer hangs.
1,Perfect fit  nice detailing best feature is that they do not bag out after wearing for a short time. good lines in back so they are more dressy than a regular legging.
0,The top was very nice and i liked the material. my problem was getting it on with the cami being attached to the top. it took me a while to figure it out. and for that reason alone i returned it.
0,It is very sheer which is too bad because the design is super cute.
1,I loved this top from the first time i saw it online. i ordered a size 10 ~i'm slim with broad shoulder & 36c~ the top fit perfect. when i opened the pkg i thought it would be too big since it looked wide but that was not the case at all. its a little longer in the back & a little shorter in the front. on me~it looks exactly like it does in the picture.its really a cute top & it looks lovely over shorts. makes a cute  casual summer outfit. i cant wait to wear it.
-1,The quality and fabric of this dress are lovely  but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless. it fit me like a sack  i ordered the m and i suppose i should've sized down  but even in the s i'm afraid this would be far too large. for reference  i am 5'7 and 135 lbs. i have a curvy build so this shape dress just wasn't right on me. i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure. returned.
-1,Just not as long as in the picture. it hit me at my hips not good!
1,This skirt is perfect! it just pulls on and lays nice and smooth. the fabric is soft and just the right thickness and stretch. i wore it with black tights and knee high boots for new year's eve and had many compliments! it runs a tad big. i am about 130lb and the small fits great although a tad larger than i would have expected. i assume it might srink in the wash a little anyway. my new favorite!
1,I love this blouse with a pair of jeans. the neckline is fairly deep but very flattering and feminine. the detail is beautiful.
1,Very cute  very comfortable. for me aesthetics and comfort must go hand in hand. this dress fits the bill.
-1,I loved the fact that this dress is cotton. it is a thin cotton  and you can see in the photos that she is wearing a black slip with a thicker strap. mine came with a nude slip. i'm thinking they all come with a nude slip. i'm not sure why they showed the dress with the black thick strap slip unless it was to show the dress as a thicker cotton than what it actually is. the dress is adorable though which makes it hard for me to decide whether to keep it and hope mine won't tear easily or to retur
-1,I bought an xl and they looked like they would have been a small. can't review anything else because i couldn't even get them on.... ridiculous
0,Loved this shirt so much that i bought in 3 colors. love the luxurious feel of the silky  flowing fabric that flatters in all the best ways. however  after washing per instructions  the fabric lost its good qualities and turned into a blah  pilled mess that gathers at the seams (especially the bottom seam). tried dry cleaning another shirt and it came out the same way as washing. looks like a cheap  lackluster layering top now and definitely won't last another season. so disappointed - if you ca
-1,I bought this suit based on the great reviews. i was so bummed when i tried it on. the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up. my torso is on the longer side so maybe that's why the bottoms keep coming up. every time i pulled the shorts down  the top would come down too  and vice versa. i am 5'5 and 120lbs and bought a 2 which is my normal size. i did like that the top had a bit of padding but that's the extent of what i liked about it. i will be returning it.
-1,Was super excited to try this on  but had to go up 3 sizes from my normal 6 and the waist was still too tight - i was swimming in the top as well. just a very strange cut and unflattering. such a bummer because it's so pretty.
0,Lovely color and sweet top  but the fabric was so itchy i couldn't wear it.
1,I love this dress! it is so much fun to wear to the beach or out to lunch! the arm holes are a little large so i wear s tank underneath!
0,The top looks like an oversized shirt in the model photo but as you can see it's not at all in person. made with what feels like hospital scrubs-meets-crisp-poplin  this shirt is stiff and does not lay flat against the body. the cut is almost triangular or bell shaped causing it to jut out - think of a flared wide leg pant - but as a shirt. the sleeves have a similar cut as well. i  too  am a 34c and found it made me look much wider as your bust will cause the shirt to move away from you. it's s
0,I really like the sundry brand. however. this is thin and to me out of character for an retailer tee. it look adorable in picture. however the coloring is way off. the navy is almost black it's so dark and the kaki stripe is a green. it's nothing like i had hoped it would be. fabric in very thin and more like a pajama top. so disappointed. it will go back. i do not make it a habit to bash a product. however with tax  shipping and 83.00 price tag. 103.11 is absolutely terrible.
1,Very cute. i received many compliments when i wore it. fits true to size (petite 2) with some good stretch in it. i am 5'3 and it was slightly longer than that on the model. it is a little odd that the buttons are all not the same. but perhaps that is part of its charm and it is not noticeable. it is very comfortable and the pictures are representative of what it looks like.
-1,The top is nice  good quality  etc.... but how do you keep the 'off the shoulder' off the shoulder? mine keeps inching up until it's just a boring white top with a strange loose neckline.
0,I knew i would love this dress  it looked so me ! my order arrived and sadly to say it looks awful i was expecting 3/4 sleeves  these were to the bottom of my wrist. i could have been fine with that but  the entire dress was so big on me. it looked like a sack. i usually wear a sz 4  or s/m this was a small. will return. if you can find one that fits i would recommend it.
-1,I think this shirt would be really cute on the right body type  just not mine. i'm 5'5  125 and a 34ddd a couple weeks post partum. thought this could be a good shirt while i'm nursing bc it's flowy but stylish. unfortunately it did nothing for me when i put it on. the cut drew all attention to my big chest---not in a good way--and distracted from my smaller lower half. made me look much bigger and heavier than i actually am. probably good for small chested girls  very tall girls or curvy on the
-1,Bought this based off the reviews here but this was a miss for me. the colors weren't as vibrant as pictured and the waist in this dress is huge. not flattering and it went back. i buy an retailer dress every week so i just exchanged this one for another one i loved. not hard to do at all
0,"I was very excited about receiving this dress. unfortunately i was a little disappointed when i opened the package  as the color was darker than on the picture.  i live in florida where the sun is always shining and although this dress has a beautiful simple design  it isn't for me as the color is too ""winter""."
1,This is a pretty dress. like the positive reviews have noted.  very figure flattering
-1,Ii loved the idea of this summer top flowing in the breeze... then i got it and the selves did nit give as much slack as i would have hoped #spandex so #returned!
0,"This top is super cute  however the bottom hem is all frayed....couldn't really tell that from the pictures. the ""flutter"" sleeves are too big...looks funny with the fraying...runs a little large as well. loved the color! perfect with white denim!"
1,This is a beautiful piece that can be paired with multiple ways.. the color is rich and classy
-1,The fabric and cut of this blouse are beautiful  but the v was so deep i could never wear it without a cami and i think that would ruin the look. i have a large chest  but the similarly cut blouse (without the textured fabric - from the same designer) fit me fine. this one is just cut differently. i even tried sizing up and down - to no avail. the photo on the model seems misleading because i don't see how the neck would lay flat or stay that high on anyone - even with a smaller chest. i was so
1,"I can't get enough of maxi dresses and i can't resist tracy reese. this stunning dress caught my eye immediately  but i was worried that the back cut out at the waist would make my backside look flatter. i'm so glad i took the plunge to buy before it sold out. this dress fits perfectly  it's flattering to my figure  the print is beautiful  the fabric and drape do not cling to my figure flaws and i'm just so happy! for sizing reference here are my stats: 5'3"" 140# 36dd and i purchased the medium"
0,I purchased this dress for the second time: it is the gingham garden dress from 2015 that was blue and white. same dress  new name and color. generally  this dress is large overall and long. i wish i could have purchased the petite size. i liked it enough to have it in black and white. this time around i ordered one size down and fit is much better.  recommendation: order 1 size down from your normal sizing as dress runs large.  the quality of the knit material is soft and flowing.
0,In the picture it looked to be a structured blazer  but when i tired it on (i got an extra small) and it was too big.
1,I ordered this bra in my normal size 32d  and it fits me perfectly. this bra is beautiful. the material seems to be very high quality  and the comfort of this bra is amazing. it's definitely a keeper.
0,On the picture shows the belt.doesn't come with the belt.
0,"I'm 5'5"" and i think fairly proportioned (120 lbs  34b) and the peplum hit well above my waist. since having kids i'm a little obsessive about avoiding any shirt that could double as maternity... and this struck me as one. it's a cute too  but once it's on i don't feel it's very flattering."
0,I really want to love this dress  the style and colors are so nice and easy. i like the loose flowy feel of the dress. it runs a tad large  but that is part of the style. what bothers me is that the fabric and embroidery is very stiff and itchy  to the point where it is uncomfortable on my arms and body even though it is a loose fitting dress. also  it has lining which is nice for modesty  but with the stiff/itchy factor mixed with lining  it feels a bit cumbersome. i haven't decided if i will k
1,"The picture of this dress does not do the colors justice. they are a very rich green and pink  which were a popular color combination in the 70's. (i was there!) it adds an authentic touch to this great peasant dress. the black and white embroidery on the bib gives it a modern flair. i am 5'6""  130 pounds  and usually wear a size six in a dress. the small fit perfect. while the dress is billowy  the square on the back pulls it in  so it doesn't fit like a tent. perfect for boots now  sandals lat"
-1,I have somewhat sensitive skin and this fabric is awful! in addition to it having no give  feeling like it will stretch out  and being slightly see-through  it is super scratchy!! it has little bits of what look to be tree material in the fabric.. awful!
1,"This was a winner retailer!!!!! bought it with my birthday discount. a bit pricey  but when i wore it (over and over again) i can see why. the material is so soft  flows beautifully and is just the right length on me. i am petite (5'3"") slender at 115 and i wear it with wedge heels  just like the model. i did iron it when i took it out of the package but have not had to iron it again.    i have received many compliments on this dress. bought the washed denim look.    thank you!!!!"
1,Love this top.  the fit is perfection!  the fabric is wonderfully soft.  i ordered the green  love this color.  will be ordering it in the grey also..  fits very true to size.
