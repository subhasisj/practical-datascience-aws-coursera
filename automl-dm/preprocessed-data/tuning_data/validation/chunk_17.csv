-1,"The fit is so bad and the construction is very poor. i'm 5'1''  100 lbs  ordered xxs petite.     first of all  when i button this  there is extreme gaping going on. the vest runs narrow  yet tall?it shifts up my torso if i move at all  making the gaping even worse.    the ""skirt"" at the bottom is made of a very cheap  thin  slightly sheeny material that you would find at a flea market. it arrived unbelievably wrinkled and crumpled  and it was just so thin. it did not meet as closely in the middl"
0,I usually follow the boho look  and this dress appealed to me immediately and it was in the color i wanted black. so excited to receive this as i knew i could wear it both as a dress and a tunic but that was not to be. the outfit consists of 2 elements: a tight fitting slip that fits awkwardly and does not give enough room in the bust nor waist areas  and an overlay dress that is really quite pretty. but it too was too tight across the bust area which made the entire upper torso ill fitting. i n
1,I love this shirt  it's easy to belt. i just wish it was tighter.
-1,Extremely cute sweater  but after having worn it twice it's already pilling up. i'd expect more for a $100 sweater.
-1,It is soft and hangs great. problem - i wore it one time - and the back balled up terrible. it looked like i had owned it for years - not worn it one time. wouldn't recommend. though it is sooooo soft!
1,This is a great pullover. very cute for lounging at home or running errands. it does run large  i ordered an xs & it's pretty big. for reference  i'm 5'7''  125 lbs & 34 b. it is also a little pricey for lounge wear but i am keeping it because it is so cute.
0,Not sure why it has gotten good ratings and or why sold out online periodically. awkward fit and flares quit a bit at waist. also has extra material at waist line so does not look flattering.
0,"Thick material and cute design. i am typically a size 2 and the small in this fit but was snug in the crotch and just zipped at the waist there is not much if any stretch. i am 5'6"" with a 26 1/2 in waist so that was unexpected. it does have cinchers at the waits but they are more for aesthetics than functionality. it is a very cute design and the fabric is nice as well as the direction of the stripes."
-1,"Got the coral reef color in a size medium. for reference  i say i am 5' 4"" because its easier than explaining that i am really 5' 3 and 3/4""  138-140 lbs.  36c bra. size-wise  i am all over the place. recently i lost weight and have been buying smalls and mediums and anywhere from an 8 to a 12 from retailer. i so wanted to love this suit and am still in love with the fabric and colors. everything in the medium fit except for the bra cups. i am not especially big but there was zero cup room."
1,Absolutely love everything about this dress. unlike many other dresses i've ordered from retailer it fits me in the chest (34c). it's very flattering. love the lace up front and the fabric is like a soft lined linen. can't wait to wear it. i got the s regular. if i was any bigger in the chest or through the ribs tho it would be too small. i almost ordered the medium and was certain i would end up needing a bigger size but the small turned out just right. like it was made for me
-1,I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very  very stiff. i was expecting something silky  or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case  it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice  but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o
0,"The fabric of this skirt is absolutely beautiful. however the fit  albeit unique  is not extremely flattering in my opinion. it may be because i am somewhat of a pear/hourglass shape rather than a more straight shape  but the fit is a little off imo. i am 5'8"" and 135# and ordered both the 6 & 8 and felt the 8 fit a little better."
1,I love this dress. it is so cute! i have another dress from the same brand (hutch) in almost the exact same shape/style so i was excited to see this one is so similar to the other dress i love. i am 5ft 8in and 145lbs  and medium fits perfectly. it's snug at the top (but not tight) and the skirt is full but not too full. the fabric is slightly thinner than i expected  but still like it a lot. if i could change one thing  it would be one inch longer....hits a tiny bit more above the knee than i t
0,I really wanted to like his dress  but it was a big miss. big big miss. look at the way the skirt is attached to the dress in the photo. it goes up high on the sides leaving a short bodice. the sequined patterns hit right at my breasts  so it looked like glittery bra cups on the front. the back glittery pattern looked like bird wings on my back. it was far shorter than i expected. overall  it looked like i was desperately trying to be a sexy angel or fairy. bad bad bad.
-1,Extremely disappointed with this top. it runs extremely large. i'm 5'2  130 lbs  34c and usually wear between a 0-2 & xs-s tops at retailer. i ordered a 0 and it looked like a maternity top on me. the bottom half of the top flared out and did not fit close to the body at all. fabric was also a gauze-like material that was not soft. unfortunately  i will be returning.
-1,This is a problem i have had with the pilcro hyphen cargos with the color dye.  the dyes in these pants are the same thing. i wore the purple color and washed in cold  gentle  cycle and they were stained/     i will return these -it's too bad because they were pretty comfortable and flattering pants.
1,This cardigan did not disappoint. i purchased the orange  which is a beautiful deep red orange that is perfect for fall. the fit is true to size and the length of the cardigan is nice  hitting at mid hip. the ruffles hang well and are not too bulky or overwhelming on my petite frame. it looks great from the side as well. i love the knitted details  the scallops  and the subtle gathers. the only flaw is that the sleeves are way too long to be practical. they come to my fingertips  so get in the w
1,"I found this to be true to size (m fit me well - 5'7""  140 lb  usually a size m for tops). it does have a straight fit  and it hits at the waist. i wouldn't call it cropped  but if you prefer longer tops you may want to layer. it looks cute with a collared shirt underneath  and you can pull the shirt's cuffs over the sweatshirt. the sleeves were a great length."
0,"Based on other reviews that this top ran large  i ordered this online in two sizes. both seemed to fit alright in my chest (although the chest fit tighter in the smaller size)  and both were much too big on the bottom. the front bottom of this shirt has a series of pleats  so the bottom of this top really  really  really flared out away from my hips. the length seemed fine on me (5'10""). the material is very thin  and i could see my nude bra through the white pattern."
0,I was excited to receive this dress because it seemed like a beautiful  breezy dress for summer. unfortunately i didn't find the fit to be very flattering. as two other reviewers mentioned there is too much fabric creating an odd bunching especially at the back waistline. i also found the dress to be a little tight across the bustline  upper arms and shoulders. the bunching can be improved by pulling the fabric of the dress forward in the front but this creates more of a plunging neckline than i
0,I like the color and the plaid pattern on this top. the material is soft to the touch and despite being petite  i bought the regular length to pair with tights. it has the feel of a baby doll because of the longer length on me. i quite like the feminine cut of the top which makes it slightly unique as far as plaid tops go. the material also doesn't feel too flimsy or cheap and the top feels well made. it will not be hard to reach for this item as it is a versatile piece  as many reviewers have n
-1,I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay  but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store  i would have passed over it. however  i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies  though!
1,This is a great  casual top that can work in all seasons. i love it with skinny pants/jeans.
1,Love this top - it is a beautiful shade of blue and the buttons at the bottom add a nice touch. it is light weight and not too long or wide. i have other t.la tops in small  but the xsm worked better for me with this top.
-1,I have purchased many dresses from retailer for weddings and events.  this is the first time i have been disappointed with the quality.  however  the sleeve on this dress ripped after lifting up my toddler son in the middle of a wedding.  the size 4 seemed to fit perfectly  but the fabric had no give.  it was not overly tight in the bust as i am bra size 34aa.  for the price  i expected better.  the color and style of the dress is gorgeous  so perhaps ordering one size up is the answer. . .
1,Living a casual life style in key largo fl. i love a fitted t-shirt instead of a boxy shape. i'm 67 years and am very active and fit. love your store. classy
0,This dress is nice colors and well made but it's just not the style for me. it almost fits frumpy. i'm not sure that a belt would even make it look good. also being 5'8  it is shorter than i'd wear. i like at least touching top of the foot for a maxi.
-1,I saw tons of people raving about this piece so i had to check it out for myself. i love the vibrant colors and the design and while the fabric is delicate it feels amazing and light. i sadly had to leave it as the store as i am a girl with a larger chest and big hips. i looked huge and it was not flattering to my shape. if this dress came in a maxi with a high waist like i would be all over it. it is beautiful.
-1,Had high hopes for this seemingly cute skirt to use as a basic in my spring and summer outfits. however  that was not the case. this skirt is not lined and the material is so so. basically  for the price  i was underwhelmed and will return it.
1,The shirt was better than it actually looked online. the only downfall was that there was a pulled thread on the shirt when i received it. it's something i can probably fix  just a little disappointed receiving in that shape.  i would recommend this top. very flattering and dressy if you want it to be.
0,The sweater is very very warm. it looks okay  not the best but not bad. i had high expectations so was disappointed to see no closure  i don't wear sweaters and jackets without closures. i like having the option of closing buttons if it gets any colder. so i am sending it back.
-1,"After trying several sizes  including petite and regular  i am sad to return this dress. the regular sizes were too long on me (i am 5'4"") and although the petite fit me just a little short  the biggest issue was how tent like it fit me. i wanted it to look like it does on the model but i just couldn't get the fit. usually i have great luck with cloth & stone."
1,"I have so many compliments on this blouse. i love the style and design. i wear it with my long cotton skirt because it runs a little short since i have a long torso and i am 5""8 tall. i would love to wear it with my skinny pants but then it won't look right in the back kinda hang out. otherwise really nice quality blouse. i would definitely buy another just to have a back up."
0,I love how different this dress is in terms of the design. it catches light beautifully. the short  biased hem makes the dress fun and flirty. but  this dress is completely sheer. there is no lining which is very disappointing. i do have a short  nude slip that makes this dress work for me. you will need a slip  for sure! unless you are rhianna. the sizing runs a little large  i probably could size down given the loose cut but overall the proportions are flattering showing off my legs. i will re
0,I didn't have any problems with the fit  i love the puffin pattern  the material is nice---it's just so short. i really haven't decided if the print is worth the awkwardness of the length  or if i'll just keep it and only wear it when it's cool enough outside to wear a tank under it  so i can avoid flashing my stomach every time i lift my arms. but  yeah...it stops right at my waist in front. way too short--stop making these great shirts so short  please.
1,This is a beautiful casual top...it is a loose fit that is generously sized so instead of my usual large i purchased the medium for a better fit...the length is perfect not too long or short! the colors coordinate great with denim!
-1,"So disappointed. i love retailer! this was a huge disappointment. i am 5'3"" and 120 pounds. when i put it on  all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look. if i wasn't so disappointed  i might have laughed. this had to have been a design mistake. i've truly never seen something so unflattering."
-1,This dress looks so cute in the pictures-i love the style. ordered typical size and it was huge-felt like many sizes too big.
1,This is a super flattering  cute tank! i've purchased it in several colors because it's such a great fit. somewhat thin material and slightly sheer (especially the white). i like that it has good coverage on the sleeves so that bra straps nor 'side boob/armpit' fat shows. looks great with pilcro capris for a cute  casual summer look! i wish they would come out with even more colors!
1,Really like the loose flowiness. runs big went from med to small with better results. style is forgiving
1,I love this top! i debated between an xs and a s  but i'm usually an xs in deletta so that's what i got. it fits perfectly and is beautiful.
-1,I ordered a regular size s and it was way too boxy for my body type and shorter than the stated length. i don't know if the length stated is from a size m  but the small was definitely shorter (in the front at least).  if you're petite with curves like me  it's not a flattering cut.
-1,I purchased this top on sale and was really excited about the style. it fit great the first time i wore it. i washed it once  according to the care instructions. after washing it in cold water and allowing it to air dry  it was basically ruined. it shrunk up in length widened out about two inches. i'm pretty bummed about it because it was cute.
0,I got this in black. will probably get in the purple print too. the purple is a bit more casual  while the black can be work appropriate if with a nice top. very comfy.
-1,Loved the look of this shirt online. i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong. the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated (almost looks as if i'm ready for take off!). unfortunately  none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model. i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size - i would have loved it! looks great from the side but sadly i can't walk around like that ;)
-1,"I love retailer and fell in love as soon as i saw this dress online. being 5'10"" i love a quality maxi dress and this one did not disappoint. however  being 5'10"" also means the top sweater overlay hits me way short. it looks ridiculous. i also thought that this was very heavy for a maxi dress and could not imagine wearing it in 80 degree weather. unfortunately after waiting so long for it's arrival this is going back."
0,I bought this in size xl and the overall fit matched the model's photos. the neckline was a bit higher than pictured. the material was pretty in person. the problem was the material's threads were too scratchy. i was uncomfortable with that scratchiness against my neck so i returned it. i did like the unique leaf pattern of the lace.
1,These crops are very well proportioned and fun. the graphic pattern is spot on trend and the unusual silhouette can spice up your pants options.  i am a fan of cartonnier and these particular pants were surprisingly generously cut in comparison to most of the styles i have. i usually need to order cropped pants in tall  but these worked with the regular inseam.
0,I ordered this in a m and it was just a big boxy tent. i really wanted to love it since the length is good for leggings and throwing on to cart kids around. it just was so big and had no shape at all. it's possible i should have sized down to a small  but i'm sending it back.
0,I'm not much for ponchos  but this one looked unique. it is thin  kind of a felt material - that was expected - but i was surprised to find it was shorter at waist than how it appears online   and it was wide horizontally. the colors were more muted and the design was slightly off center unlike pic. the turtleneck was thick and itchy. it was a return.
1,I have to agree with another reviewer that this runs slightly small. i'm 5'8  an athletic pear with narrow shoulders  34c  and usually a 6 in tops at retailer. since the top looks a little short on the model  i sized up to an 8  since i'd rather have it be flowy and a little longer. i'm very glad i did because it hits at my low hip  and if it were any smaller  it'd be too tight in my chest. since it doesn't stretch  you need some space for your arms to move. if i could do it again  i'd actually si
-1,Pretty design  but when i tried it on  the fabric was thin and delicate. i don't think it would last long with much wear. too bad. if the fabric were sturdier  it'd be great as the cut is flattering and i love the pockets.
0,Ordered these in two colors( moss and bronze)  same size (26). the moss fit perfectly and the bronze  i can't even button. so very frustrating  particularly when shipping fees are involved. i'm keeping the pair that fit but was hoping to have a couple pairs. perhaps i'll try on another pair in the store. its a nice lean slimming pant that will work from fall through spring. the material is a bit thick for summer. soft and a tad stretchy to allow ease of movement. looking forward to wearing with
-1,I though this dress would be similar to the turtleneck swing dress by maeve. it's not. first of all  it runs very large. i purchased a small (i am usually a xs or small in maeve  i purchased a small in the turtleneck swing dress). the shoulders were very wide  you had to manually cross the fabric around your neck but it didn't lay as flat as what i wanted around my chest  and it was quite large around my rib cage and stomach making it rather shapeless. i really wanted this dress to work (i love
-1,I really wanted to like this dress and was so disappointed when it came in the mail. if you have any sort of hips  the light pattern in the middle doesn't do you any favors. this made my hips look soooo wide! and the seaming and gathering in the middle was just off. if it was one continuous piece of fabric it might look better. with the seam  the pattern was cut up and looked pieced together. that just drew too much attention to my stomach and hips. it had to go back.
0,The dress fits me like a tent and i looked pregnant. maybe this style isn't for me and i even sized down. otherwise the quality was lovely with an embroidered area on the top and the fabric style mixing was great and very trendy. it didn't work for me for the right person this is a very well made dress.
-1,This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big. i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there  this went back
0,"The material was a little itchy in my opinion. the fit was pretty big. almost a night shirt. i'm 5' 3""  and i will probably only wear this around the house with tights. i got a small. i purchased the orange color online. stay away if you have an olive skin tone! it's the pinkish it appears to be on be on the website. i'm 130 pounds 34d"
1,I ordered this dress to wear for a rehearsal dinner. i almost consistently wear a medium in most clothing but for this picked the large because of my height. i was for sure it would be too short in any other size. when i put it on i was drowning in it! i would definitely order the small if i had the time before the rehearsal. has the potential to be super cute and flattering  yet the timing and sizing didn't work out. definitely give this one a try!
0,I ordered this dress when it was briefly on sale with an extra percent off. i was very excited to receive it in my usual size large  and wear with a jean jacket and cowboy boots. when i took it out of the package  i could tell it looked really small. i didn't even try it on. i had my daughter who wears a size small try it on  and she couldn't even get it over her hips. if you are tall and thin like the model  it will work for you. it is made of cupro  looks exactly like the photo  the color is g
1,I needed a white denim pant and this one fits fine. it isn't as slimming as i had hoped for because it isn't a stretchier denim. but  my husband says he likes how they look and they do fit. pants are not easy for me. i have a generous booty and thighs and a small waist. quality is good.
0,I wanted to love this  as it seemed like a fun and carefree take on a little black dress.    but how did i not see that this has tassels? but they're there  a whole row of them - look hear the bottom of the skirt part  between the colorful stripes and the lacy area. that's a deal breaker for me - i really can't stand the way these look  and they're not the sort of thing you can easily remove.    the fabric  though nice quality  has no stretch at all. i wasn't expecting stretch  but i'd just say
0,This is such beautiful material  but the sleeves at the shoulders are terrible -- the gathered material makes it look like i'm wearing shoulder pads. that structured element compared to the rest of the dress (relatively unstructured) just looks ridiculous. i was so looking forward to this dress  and now it's going back.
1,I ordered the red motif in size xl. for me  the fit matches the model so i think it's true-to-size. the only larger area on me is for the armholes. i use a cami so my bra won't show when raising my arms. since it's made of rayon/spandex and is a longer length  it's a little clingy along my hipline for my pear-shape. but  overall  it's so soft and comfortable. the colors in the floral pattern are beautiful. prettier in person. there's no problem with pattern placement either. a great top for summ
1,I ordered this in the lavender and love the rich color! looks great with my blonde hair. the bell sleeves  which are all the rage right now  add to the feminine look. i wore it with jeans and espadrilles for a fab boho look!
0,I agree with the first reviewer. this dress is just ok; nothing to write home about. if you need a throw on dress in a pinch  it's nice to have on hand  but there are probably a lot of other retailer dresses that fit the bill that are better quality than this one. it is also very body conscious in the back. the material is a thin  ribbed rayon - on the cheap side. overall  it's a comfortable piece  but it's more like a thin  long-sleeve t-shirt  rather than a quality dress. it would have been a gr
0,I was so excited to get this top! i love the bow at the neck and the frill sleeves  so current. unfortunately  it was difficult for me to pull it over my head! the neck opening is too small  and there are no buttons. i have a pretty small head and very fine straight hair  so i can imagine that others will have a similar issue getting it on!    i am keeping it because i love the style  but will need to alter the neck myself. the rest of the top fits just a bit loose.  i got the x-small and am a 3
1,"My favorite pair of ags. i normally wear sz26 but i have awkward proportions when it comes to finding jeans that are actually ""ankle"" length on me. i orders these in a petite and went a size up to be safe. it doesn't seem like they've stretch out any and they fit exactly how i want. i love the dark wash bc they can be both dressed up and down."
-1,I was excited to get this romper  but it just didn't work. i'm petite with a large bust and the blousy design of the top portion just hung like a bag on me. returned.
1,"I had a hunch that this would run big based on the style and brand  so ordered an xs instead of my normal s and it was perfect! the fit on me is exactly like the model shot - swingy but still cute and falls nicely. i am 5'7""  128#  34a for reference. i got the orange color and would say it is a little more on the reddish/burnt orange side than what is pictured. it's very cute - i'm happy to keep it at the promo price."
