-1,Wasn't crazy about this top. it looked great online but in person it's just a boring and lifeless top.
-1,I love off the shoulder looks and had high hopes for this top. unfortunately the folded top portion doesn't stay down at all. i found myself pulling at it all day and eventually gave up. the material is also not the best.
0,This is a cute top but the fit is problematic. it runs small on top especially around the bust and sleeves but then it flares below the waist in a billowy and unflattering way with way too much fabric.  i got both an xsp and an xxsp. the xxsp fit better on bottom but i could hardly pull my arms through the sleeves. both are going back unfortunately. for reference i'm 5' 103 lbs 32b.
0,This shirt was cute and fit well- true to size- but i felt for the material  it was not worth the $68. the colors offered were a little drab. i thought the grey could work for me  but it didn't. the neck hole looks a little sloppy for a $68 shirt- the roll doesn't lay flat all the way around. would be better priced in the $30-$40 range.
0,Definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt. just too large; too much fabric for me. i'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod. i wouldn't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top. i think the colors are also a bit duller in person. love the concept though!
-1,I wanted to like this dress  but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose  does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy  so if you are well-endowed  your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result  the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model)  and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves  this would likely be very flattering  but
1,"I was expecting to love this based on the reviews and my prior experience with this brand  but i'm a little unsure. the front part hangs a bit too low on my 5'4"" frame  yet i think a petite would have the slits too high on the sides. i'm just not sure it hangs right on me. it's fitted through the arms and shoulders nicely  and looks great with the front loosely tucked. just not what i was expecting."
-1,"These are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter  but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight  but these fit perfectly (even on the looser side) and ripped effortlessly. pretty embarrassing given the price! bringing these back!     for reference ( if you decide to try your luck)  i am 5'7""  128# and my normal size s was perfect."
1,The picture doesn't do it justice. i am wearing it right now with cream pants to work with a cardigan i also purchased from retailer and it looks amazing. the fit is true to size. i am large chested but it fit comfortable...i did go up a size so it is a little longer than i like but i think if i had picked my normal size it would have been a little too snug at the chest. still looks amazing. i feel very feminine in this blouse. good quality material.
1,I purchased this dress for my 31st birthday and i am so glad that i did! i saw it in my local retailer store and immediately had to try it on! it is very flattering because i am 5'0  usually a size 8 or 10 in dresses and it fit perfect! the material is light  definitely suggest delicate cycle and hang-drying  but it is nice because you can layer this dress with a vest or coat! highly recommend this dress!
0,I loved the fit  color and style  but the fabric seemed very thin and cheap. i was worried that it would tear easily. this is getting returned.
0,Runs really big. i usually wear small and this was falling off my shoulders. very comfortable and soft material. also looks brighter in pic than in person.
1,I absolutely love this sweater....it is perfect for fall
-1,Very cheap looking material. looks cheap to cost $158.
1,I've been wanting a higher-waisted  button-front skirt. this one was perfect because of the texture on the denim.. it makes it dressy enough to wear to work if you are in a business-casual setting. i think it has a ton of versatility for multiple seasons. i'm normally a 0 or 2 in dresses (5'6  118 lbs) and i ordered a 0 in the skirt  as the natural waist is a little on the large side. i love it!
1,"I love this top! i purchased the gray simply because i felt it would go with more. i can pair it with blue jeans  my pink pilcro chinos  and even my turquoise pilcro shorts. i love that this tee doesn't have the rolled sleeves  so it's a little more finished looking. i tried on both the small and medium and both fit  but i preferred the tapered fit of the small and ultimately went with that. for reference  i'm 5'8""  140 lbs  32d chest. i do think $58 is hefty for a t-shirt  so you could roll the"
0,I thought this top would be a nice addition to my fall wardrobe  and while the color didn't disappoint  everything else did. it's a very loose slub so it's very see through and thin  i'd have to wear a cami under it. also the tie front has a very high slit! like it went almost halfway up the shirt and definitely would have shown skin unless you layered the shirt. i do think this top would be a cute throw on top for yoga/ gym wear  but definitely not at this price. pass for me sadly...
1,"Soft and flowy. fit is great. quality is great. i love this dress and i purchased in the turquoise color as well. i haven't worn a dress in 10+ years so i had a lot of reservation that this would be my first. highly recommend. i paired this with 4"" short black suede boots and black tights. many compliments (even from my husband and he doesn't usually pay much attention)."
-1,"This top did nothing for me. it billowed in the front and was not flattering. for reference  i am 5""4  115 pounds  and small chested. i ordered the smallest size the top came in (cannot recall if it was an xs or 0). i promptly returned it."
-1,I wanted to like this top  especially because of its comfortable material and color  but the asymmetrical shape didn't hang well on me. it also runs big - i got a small  and although the bodice fit okay  the sleeves were long  and the bottom of the top looked mishaped and dumpy. this top will be going back.
0,I bought both black and white shirt. white is see through completely. black is ok. but the material is still too thin. i feel like it is going to tear after the first wash. not worth the money. i bought plenty of similar shirts from the same brand and this run is way too cheap.
1,These jeans are pricey and worth every dollar.  fits in the right area and makes your butt look perfect.  ladies  if you have thick legs...these jean are meant for you.
-1,I ordered this dress in the green color. the dress did not look like the picture. i returned the dress since it looked like something to wear to a farm barnyard dance. i returned the dress.
1,I liked this dress but wasn't sure about the color on me. i tried it on anyway. originally  i tried on the 0  but it seemed big so i ordered the 00. also usually i order petite  but this dress is already short (and i am not getting younger)  so i went with regular size this time. color was not bad on my pale skin  i think the hue was ok (surprisingly). one thing that might bug the perfectionist in me  the zig zag isn't always aligned  the waist  for instance was crooked  but if it is like that e
0,I tried on the xs petite  and liked it but didn't love. the arm holes seemed big  you could see my pink bra peeked through on te sides. also  the material is soft but thin (see through  somewhat). the xs petite  just seemed big overall  i would try the xxs petite if it goes on sale and is available. i am 115 lbs  30dd for reference.
-1,"Great hopes but a sorry disappointment. at this price  one should be able to expect better pattern alignment as shown on model. the pattern in the garment i received was poorly matched on either side of the button placket. i am 5'6"" and ordered xxs. garment was significantly over-sized. i would have had to order one and probably two sizes smaller to achieve a decent fit. because of the oversizing  the shape is more boxy than it appears in the catalog photo. sadly  this buttondown has to be retur"
-1,I usually buy xs or s in retailer clothing and the pieces usually fit perfectly. this time i purchased my first petite item because i was worried the length of the pant leg would fall at an unusual spot if i didn't. i'm 5'4 and i ordered a petite small. i was swimming in it. the elastic in the back was so loose you could see directly down my pants. i wanted to love this but unfortunately the size did not work for me.
0,Not sure about this yet. reordered larger size because it hits much higher than shown. belly peeked out from under it! ordered 6 and i'm normally a small/6. like the design but really short. 
0,Love the style  fabric and fit generally  but even ordering down a size  i could yank them right down. trying going down one more size  but not sure it will work as much as i want it to.
-1,I bought this in size xl. it ran much shorter & smaller than is typical for this brand. i found the arms tighter on me compared to the model's photos. the lace itself was pretty  intricate and washed well. i wish this shirt had worked but i ended up donating it after wearing it a couple times. the cropped length and close-fit just didn't work on me. i thought the sleeve shape was pretty. with just a little more material  this would have been a favorite. i hope it works well on whoever receives i
1,"I am 5-9 1/2"" tall  150 lbs  i bought the 8 in the honey color. they fit perfectly. there is some stretch and they are super soft! which for some reason is totally why i buy clothes. the length is good since they are capris. also  they did not have my size in store  so they had them shipped  for free  to my home. received them within 3 business days.    i would very much recommend them for a casual  fun look. the honey color will look great with navy  grey  and white for summer."
1,At the beginning of the season i lusted over an ivory haute couture side-sliced tunic so much that i almost sprang for the $800 price tag. when i saw this at retailer  i realized it was similar  but had certain design elements that made it even more unique than the other. i just received it  and i was not disappointed! that cable neckline is beautiful  the 3/4 sleeves are perfect to show off a bracelet or two  and whether worn with skinny jeans  as shown  or wide leg trousers (as the haute
0,I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however  the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes.
-1,"Tried this dress in a small. i am 5'6""  135lbs  34c. the small was huge - the sash helped some  but looked like a potato sack on me. also  i noticed the fabric was piling slighly in the store. i had high hopes for this dress but left this one in the store."
1,"I read all the reviews before purchasing this and took the advice of others on sizing up. i am 5'4"" hourglass shape (32d  27 inch waist  size 28 pant size) and normally wear a size 4p in retailer dresses. i ordered a 6p and the top was way too big on me. i went straight to an retailer store to try on a 4 regular and the top half was perfect on me. a little too long for my liking (about an inch below my knee)  so i re-ordered it in a 4p. this dress ran true to size for me. i recommend trying it on in"
-1,The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering  flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp  stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.  dear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to
1,"This poncho is lovely. i found it fits perfectly. im 5'4""  125 and got the xs/s..just long enough (loke jacket length) and the hood doesnt add extra weight (doesnt drag it down the back). arm holes are approriate size. very cool piece for any weather layering."
1,This is a very well made top  i like the cut and it fits true to size. very nice quality and the colors schemes are unique. i'm happy with this purchase.
0,This top is beautiful! but the fabric is really stiff and itchy. in addition  it's rather cropped or short. the real disaster and heart break for me was when i washed it. the tag recommends dry cleaning  but allows for hand washing. i should have dry cleaned - it shrunk even more when i washed it on delicate setting in cold. too bad  because this looks so cute the first time you wear it. if you're up for a dry cleaning bill and don't mind a little stiff scratchy material  you'll be fine buying t
0,"Cute in concept  so large in reality. i am 5'3""  size 24 in jeans. i was swimming in these. i mean the seat is huge and the length of the rise is super long. don't even try if you are a little person. long and lean  yes  would probably look great on you."
0,Cute shirt but not worth the price. i did purchase it at 20% off but would have waited for a better sale. the yellow is a nice fall color
1,I bought this with the intention of taking it on a very warm trip - and i think it'll do just fine! it's a wonderful open-gauge knit - delicate and light  but substantial enough that i don't fear snagging it constantly. the cloth has a nice weight and drape  and while the fit is on the loose side  it does look intentional. wonderful as a pullover or by itself. i have the minty blue-green color  and it's divine. definitely worth the price.
-1,This is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on. fit perfectly as a size 6 should in the arms  shoulder  chest... then the waist was huge! just hung off of me like a flour sack. it was wider than the chest measurements  which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic. combine that with the high-low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject. sent back immediately  do not buy this if you have (or want to appear to have) an hourglass figure  it will do nothing for
0,I ordered this online and i love the style  but didn't like the print as much as i thought i would.
0,This is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me  the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady. i miss not having to consider those things. the red color is lovely and the dress is modest. i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita.
-1,Completely oversized top  size medium was swimming on me.....boxy  baggy  shapeless -- what more can i say? even in an xs this would not have fit in any way like the photo  returned.
0,This is a beautiful sweater that i wanted to love but i couldn't for a few reasons i thought i'd share: the color is bright orange. it is not softer like peach in the picture. it also was more clingy than a curvy woman like me can wear. i thought'd be more swingy but it was more structured. very pretty and good quality tho.
0,Such quality went in to this dress - it is beautiful. the torso is lined and the tulle is not super poofy at the waist. it is  however  not made for the busty gal. i am a 32 dd  the fabric comes in at the arm pits making for narrow coverage around the chest. also this dress is short waisted  it is almost an empire on me. i wish it worked  as it is lovely. perhaps it will work on the someone super thin? so sad about it!
0,This cardigan is very cute in the picture and i really wanted to love it but it just didn't seem worth the price. the material is kind of itchy to me and i wasn't a huge fan of the wide edges in the front. the colour is very nice and feminine.
0,This blouse is super cute but oddly sized. i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust. the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage  so this had to go back. i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer  i just couldn't make it work  .
-1,I opened the package and the dress is two pieces. it is the skirt part with an orange cami top that the sweater goes over. the sweater was too short for me  as i am busty and would not work. i ordered my normal size and the band around the rib cage did not go from side to side so i didn't try it on.
-1,Much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo. when i pulled it out of the package i thought i'd ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow. but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly  with beautiful detail and high quality material  but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape. it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion. it doesn't look anything like the phot
-1,"Well...this is ""on me"" as i saw this hanging in the store  but way off on my size which is xxs petite.    i looked too quickly and got a nice sa to order it for me.    both pieces are transparent - no opaque lining at all is inside. both pieces are made of fragile clingy materials. there is no ""flow "" just cling. the size is much too big so the resulting look is of two bad pieces hanging oddly without any real shape.    this may be the first time i really just not recommend a piece - at all. bes"
1,This top is really cute. the fabric is soft with a little stretch to it. the lace shoulders with the denim cutouts add so much to this top. i was afraid it might make it too stiff & bulky around the shoulders  but it doesn't. very cute. the armholes are cut on the bigger side  but not so big that it shows your bra strap or anything.(just comfortable) the cut is also very nice and the pleats make it more body slimming. runs pretty tts. i ordered my usual medium and it's not quite as form fitting
1,Comfortable and loose fitting- perfect for summer weekends when you just want an easy dress to throw on. can go from home to running errands to going out for lunch. good color  too!
0,The fringe and fit were beautiful  but the lace with it (a little hard to see in the photo) seemed like an odd pairing -- just too much going on. returning . . . .
1,Another cloth and stone success! love the back! denim goes with most anything!
-1,I was really disappointed in the shirt. the blue embroidery is a lot darker than what is shown in the photo  and barely stands out against the black. the photo does not accurately depict this shirt. i will be returning.
0,Looks beautiful online but has too much material and the zipper catches on the lace. also runs very large  i am normally a small but would need and xs in this dress
1,Falls beautifully and the color is vibrant. can be dressed up or worn casually. texture adds even more uniqueness. a little heavy but this is outweighed by its other lovely features.
0,I agree with the other reviewers; this sweater was strangly shaped in the waist  in an unflattering way. the rest of it was beautiful though. looks too much like maternity  even in a petite xs  so it's going back.
-1,This sweater looks great in the picture but when it came in the mail turned out to be enormous. i tried it with a belt on like in the picture but that just made the whole sweater bunch up everywhere. the quality is nice. maybe sizing down would help. but the medium/large is going back. i am normally a medium.
-1,I ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event - one 00 petite  one 00. the style  color and cut are all perfect. one not so minor downfall  however. the zippers on both dresses were faulty - they both broke in the same spot  both during the first time just trying them on. i can't get either of them to even budge now - will either need to take back or get fixed. very sad about this.
-1,Did not work for me. whatsoever. the stripes were adorable but the piece just didn't fit like on the model. the collar was practically choking me and the tie just didn't make my figure look the way it normally does. aka i looked frumpy and chunky  which i'm not. going back.
1,I wish i could buy this is more colors! so easy to dress up or dress down
1,I originally bought these jeans in my true size. after wearing them a few times i realized they stretched out quickly making it hard to wear them again. retailer recommended i go down a size and now they are my favorite jean!  they are a little tight for the first 5 mins  and then they are perfect fit wear after wear. and so soft!
1,I am amazed this is still on sale. it's so comfortable and fabulous!!
-1,I just got this in the mail the other day. i was really excited and then crushed. one  buttons go all the way down and not what is in the photo. it takes it from hip whimsy to granny old lady sweater and then the minute i put it on it started pilling. it looked old and i wore it about 6 hours. i also used the roller lint remover on it and it pulled off one of the eyes on the snail. it is soft and felt comfy but look raggy and therefore it is going back. too bad but not what i bought and then not
1,I got the top in green  it is very soft and comfy. it does flare out a little if you wear it untucked but looks really cute tucked into jeans or a skirt.
