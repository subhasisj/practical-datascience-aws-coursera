0,I have mixed feelings about this dress. the color is fantastic. not too bright  not too dark. the material is super soft and comfortable and the length was perfect. i did end up returning this item though as no matter which bra i chose  the straps showed. it just was not hitting my right on the shoulders. i do not like having my bra straps show or constantly be trying to tuck them away (especially at a wedding or work?). this is what ultimately led me to return the dress ? even though it is beau
0,I loved the colors on this dress  but i don't like the way it fits. it is tight around the shoulders  but the rest of the dress is really big and has no shape
1,I ordered this in xsp navy with the merlot/burgundy flower and it fits above the knees as pictured. the tunic is medium weigh and has a-line shape with a loose waist and i find it very comfortable. the sleeve are straight cut (not tight) and 3/4 quarter in length. i will wear it with leggings and boots/booties this coming fall.. i find this tunic is well-made and disagreed with one review that it is cheaply made. (wrong color?) fyi: 102 lbs. 32c
1,I adore this dress. i bought a little over a month ago and have already worn it many times- rare for me. it is so easy to throw on and yet it's stylish and flattering- i don't have the time or energy i used to get dressed up so i love this. when i bought it  it was knotted on one side in the front. that's the only way i wear it now. it just adds something to it and gives it more shape. i've washed it several times (laid flat to dry) and it has held up well. i'm definitely bookmarking this to buy
1,I'm 5'5  145lbs and i'm usually a small/medium depending on the vendor. i bought this shirt in a red  medium and love it. yes  it's boxy and a little big but lays nicely and i think it's meant to be a bit big. i've worn a black cami underneath and the shoulder hangs off a little to the side giving a little extra sexy look to it. this shirt washes well per instructions  didn't shrink or loose it's shape and i've washed it three times now. i've had many compliments on how cute this shirt is  love
-1,Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing  the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up.
0,"Pros: material is amazing  super soft and quality thickness (but not like uber this  just enough  it will last). also seems like it won't wrinkle much which would make it a great dress to throw in a bag for a trip. fits well in the shoulders  chest and the length is good.    cons: the ""waist"" line is really tight and really really high. i'm 5'8""  150lbs and my usual medium is pretty tight. of course it hits me on the rib cage too  which is so weird. it's way higher than it should be.    i'll pro"
0,This dress had so much promise from the picture. i loved the midi length  color  and fascinating waist detail. i ordered online  so there was no way to try on before purchasing. the fit was disappointing. it fell in an unflattering manner at every point; a tad too low at the waist; a tad too long at the shin. just kind of saggy all around. bummed  but this is not to say it wouldn't fit someone with a different body shape better. the quality of fabric is nice  and the color is lovely.
0,The sleeves were very tight in the upper arm area but the body was blousy  too blousy so to go up a size for the arms would mean it would be very oversized in the body. i like the fabric (nice and thick) but it did not work for me.
-1,I ordered this dress in my usual sz 2 it seemed to be tight on the hips   then i tried the next sz 4 and it was tight because  i realized that the lining was very sticky  and would bunch up underneath making the dress look defective on me  not for curvy on bottom. i think if you are more slim down below this will maybe work but i had to return for this reason. i was considering cutting out the lining because it was so cute  and i really liked the look of the dress  if it goes on sale i may purch
-1,I am of average height  but these pants are so long!! i considered altering them because i like the print  but i don't think it's worth the effort for workout attire so they're going back. shame!!
1,Beautiful flattering blouse
-1,Super cute dress online on the model. what you can't tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight. it might be my body type. otherwise  it's super cute in person and i wish it would've fit better!
1,Unlike other reviews i find this top to run true to size. for reference i'm 5'3  117 lbs  34 b cup  and took an xs. top fits comfortably  no tightness around the chest  and sleeves' fullness isn't overwhelming. the lace is see through  so a cami is a must. top is of excellent quality and craftsmanship. i have not laundered it yet  so i can't comment on that. so happy with my purchase! a keeper for sure!!
-1,Sometimes i order things online that i can hardly wait to arrive  and then once they do  i wonder if i made a mistake when ordering it. this is one of those times  and it was not my mistake. the shirt i received is not like this one. it is an xs  but it is quite large falling inches below where this one hits on the model. everyone i have shown the shirt to says that it is a denim blue color  not grey at all. it is a pretty color  but not what i thought i was ordering. i hate it when this happens
-1,"I wanted to love this top  but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it  and while i love the pattern  the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms  and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference  i am 5'10"" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes  and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to"
1,I had been eying this dress online for a while and when it finally came into stores i was so excited! this dress is so gorgeous and very flattering on my body. i love the bottom of it  it is more of a u cut in the front and square in the back. add an ada wrap belt and perfection!
1,The blue color is sublime - the material velvet iridescent cool - the fit is loose and not something to wear to show off your figure but it is has a cool swingy boho vibe that was what i was expecting ... add a cool shirt jacket to elevate it and give it more structure
0,Loved the print/pattern and the light grey.....i think it might have been better if reversed (it has a v in the back  and the front neckline was very intrusive and scratchy to me). i'm normally a small but got this in a medium and it was very short on me. wish it could have worked but returning it.
0,I tried this in my normal sp. i found it to run a little snug  but the neckline was way too low for every-day wear.
-1,Mine came smelling like gasoline. not sure why  but i would have kept it otherwise. it's a smell that will be really hard to get out. looks like the picture.
-1,This top is very wide and shorter than in appears in the picture. it also has a strong chemical smell. i've had a couple pieces with that smell in the past and the smell never washed out.
1,Love these pants. they are so easy to wear and look really polished and put together. i bought all 3 colors but i had to go a size up so that they draped correctly on me. i am usually a 4 but bought a 6.    i also love that they hit above the belly button so they work with longer crop tops.    i do wish they came in more colors.
1,This is an attractive  fitted vest. the tight belt on the back gives it a new look  great shape. the fabric is good quality. the neck is tight and high. i usually get a small at retailer  but this small is way too tight and there is no way you could put a sweater under which you usually do in weather cool enough for a vest. judging from the photo  i would guess she is an extra small wearing a small or medium. it looks good with taupe or brown pants/jeans
0,I bought this sweater the minute i saw it  and waited for over six weeks for it to come off of back order (it was further delayed from even what i was told when i first ordered it).   i was beyond excited when it finally arrived and wore the sweater the day after i received it... i had a long flight and thought it was the perfect option for keeping comfy on a plane.   i was so disappointed that by the time i got off my flight four hours later  the sweater had not one  not two  but three differen
-1,I'm not sure if the top i received was damaged or if the design didn't consider gravity but this is not what i expected. i really want to like this top  but i don't see how i can wear it.
1,"This is a stunning  flattering  well-designed and sized  magnificent  and yet wearable  comfortable summer blouse! i am a busty  34f  size 8  and this lovely piece makes me look amazing. i most highly recommend to any woman. the 100% cotton body has a very soft feeling and a little bit of ""give"". i experienced no pulling at the chest or back  which can happen for me. the bottom 2"" of the crochet v is backed by the body of the top  so you may not need a cami. the combination of leaf print/crochet"
1,I love the fabric  since it's fall wasn't expecting it to be light. but its not heavy either. just the right balance.  this is one of those classics. i love the collage like pattern of the fabric.  the fit is true to size and looks great with bootie/boots. (dressed up or down).
0,Yummy  soft material  but very faded looking. so much so that i am sending it back. if a faded look is something you like  then this is for you.
-1,Dress looks beautiful  but the fitting is very off. i ordered a size 2 which is the dress size i usually wear ( i'm 5;4 and 115lbs). the chest area fits perfectly  but the hip area is extremely tight and the lower back area was lose. i exchanged it for a 4  the hip area was a bit tight and the shoulders were too lose. if i ordered the 4p  i have a feeling it would be too tight. it feels like  it's meant for someone with very small hips and a large abdomen. also  this dress is very stiff  can't d
0,"I agree with the other reviewer who stated this sweater is very ""80's""!! online it looks minorly fluffy with muted colors  but in person it's a bad overly-fuzzy christmas sweater with super bright 80's colors!! if you're going for kitschy / tacky / retro this may work for you  but if you are looking for the sweater in the photo you'll be disappointed... :( it looked to be true to size  but to be honest i hated it so much i didn't even try it on."
-1,I wanted to love this shirt. it's not my usual style buy it looked so great online. unfortunately the actual shirt is much more brown in color and design than i thought looking online. i'm fair coloring & it just wasn't flattering. i'm thin but have a larger chest and this style just wasn't right for me. could definitely be cute on someone else but not a good match for me.
1,"Ordered this dress online and hoped for the best  because there wasn't a size chart to reference. i'm usually in between a size small and a medium  i ordered the size small and it fit well. for a more flowy look i would have gone with the medium.  everything about this dress is soft  i love it! even the ribbon is delicate  soft and made of quality material. the lining feels like heaven.     this dress goes to the floor on me - i'm 5' 7"" - i was expecting it to be more mid ankle length  but i sti"
0,I bought this tank for work  but the color of the print is slightly muted compared to the photo. i usually wear a xxs or xs (i am 100 lbs  5'1) and i got the xs thinking it will be loose  which i wanted. the arm holes were down to my waist  and it was also unusually wide. the quality of the fabric is nice though  not to heavy and not too thin.
1,"Love the clean lines  the texture  and the slight sheen on this skirt which does run a bit large in the waist. the online photos are very true to what the fabric looks like. it is a stiffer  but lightweight fabric so the skirt stands away from the body. the quality of the finish is excellent and i really appreciate the hidden zipper and pockets. . fit: runs large in the waist. the size 2 i have measures 27"" on the top inside of the waistband  and i think the model is wearing a size too loose oth"
0,"Yes  this top is not of the best quality but i bought it on sale with an additional 25% off. it has a very cute design on the back and will be cute on while running errands on a hot day. it's true to size: i'm 5'6""  150 lbs and m fit well."
-1,I was so excited to get this robe in the mail but was beyond disappointed when i opened the package. the fabric is extremely stiff and thin. the fabric felt like something curtains would be made out of and the white background was see through. the robe is very short and cut small in the shoulders  therefore it looked like i was wearing a piece of children's clothing. i also ordered the matching pj pants but didn't even take them out of the package after seeing how rough and see through the mater
1,This top is super comfy and easy to wear. i found it to be a bit darker tan than it looks online  but still quite cute. it's flowy but still gives you shape  overall it was a great buy.
1,"I love this dress. i bought this dress in both a m and a s. i was worried about how ""loose"" the dress would fit and also how short it would be. the information about the model wearing the dress only said that she was 5'10"" but not what size dress she was wearing. i am 5'11"" and am in between a dress size 2 or 4. the medium was way too wide  but the small was still long enough with the perfect amount of flow. i purchased the green/slate color  which is more green and has very faint stripes. very"
0,"I am 5'2"" and 115lbs......ordered the blue motif in small petite. they were not only too big overall but were way too long. i had to roll them up several times to get the right length. because of fabric design these would definitely have to be hemmed. i had to check tag because i thought for sure i got sent a regular length but they were petite. not sure if they are worth trying in a smaller size..... pants were really comfy but maybe too pajama like for my taste."
-1,I was so excited to get this top in the mail. i loved the colors  print  cut  everything. i put it on and was so disappointed  the top looks so much better on the model. i don't know if i should have gone down a size (i go between an xs and s)  but it looked terrible on me! my husband took one look at me in it and said that's being returned. still disappointed
1,I am in love with this dress. ordered online in both my usual 4 and 6 (i go back and forth) and this time i kept the six. there is a little bit of stretch to the fabric but it has nice structure and the cap sleeves make it a welcome addition to my wardrobe. i plan on wearing this as a day-to-night dress since it's appropriate for work and for an evening out.
0,Loved this dress and ordered it based on glowing reviews. ordered size large because i weigh 155 pounds and have a large 34g bust. the dress skimmed nicely over my body but the baby doll style fit loosely and made me look really wide from the side. i probably could have sized down for a better fit  but it might have just emphasized my bust. the fabric has a substantial weight and it's lined. best as a fall  winter dress. the embroidery is beautiful. i disliked the intense black color around my f
1,Fits great  comfortable!
0,Liked the netting around the collar but the whole blouse was very baggy. order size down.
0,.unfortunately it hit at the widest part of my hips  so it wasn't very flattering. the point in the back was also kind of odd  and off center. i had to return. pretty color  though.
-1,I loved fabric  print and back detail. design  however  was a little too boxy to be flattering on me. even at great price i sent it back.
1,"I saw this online and said to myself  next time you are in the retailer store look for this dress. i am glad i did! i bought the neutral dress (off white tan.black) because i knew it would go with everything and most occasions. i am 5'6""  136 pounds  the small fit me perfect! in retailer dresses i am between a small/med. the top of the dress is lined and form fitting which is a plus. the off white coored section does go across the chest so one must wear a neutral colored lined bra even though the to"
1,I bought this in blue and have worn it with jeans  khaki shorts  and camo pedal pushers. added just a perfect amount of feminine detail without being over the top. i'm loving that it shows off my shoulders (they're tan from my vacation and i've been working like a fiend on my arms in the gym). it's well made too!
0,I almost bought this skirt yesterday in store  but decided against it because the fabric was subpar. the skirt i tried on was snagged and unraveled. i selected another skirt  which i purchased. as the sales associate was folding the skirt  i noticed that this one was also snagged and unraveling. despite loving the style and fit  i had to be realistic with my lifestyle and decided to return it then and there. if there were two severe snags on two skirts before even leaving the store  how would th
1,I agree with everything the other reviewer stated. this top is very billowy and runs large  it would be nice if i didn't have a chest! the other issue with this top is the macrame detailing is made more out of a satin like material and i wanted it to look closer to natural raw fiber. the pink is slightly more pink in person but it's not that far off. had to return.
0,"This shirt looks nice on the model  but it felt stiff and unflattering on me. i am 5'5""  135lbs  34c  and the size 4 fit overall. i just didn't happen to like it on me."
-1,I absolutely fell in love with this dress in the store and immediately scooped it up in black. wore it 3-4 times on hot summer days and it was perfect! very comfortable  easy to throw on and dress up or down. i decided to hand wash instead of dry cleaning (as i usually do) and after hanging dry  it became significantly more translucent than it had been before! i can no longer wear this dress because you can see everything through it. it's as though the fabric completely changed after being wet.
0,I read prior reviews and decided to go forward with my purchase. i am so pleased that i did. the m fit nicely. the fabric is not as soft as i had wished. however  i think with wear it will become broken in.
0,I ordered this in black and red. i had high hopes based on the reviews this received  but it's just ok. i will be returning.
1,"I have a short torso and short arms  so i purchased this in a petite medium. i probably could've worn the ps  but i do like the little extra room. it is a classic shirt dress with just enough of today's trendy ""frayed edge"" to make it contemporary. the fabric is super soft and lays nicely. i can imagine wearing this through the seasons with a variety of shoes/legwear & accessories! looking forward to it."
-1,Way too much fabric; sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip - eek! might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric  but the extra fabric just piles up on itself... the outer layer also doesn't feel like it will breath. add the cotton lining  and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer. returning.
0,This is a comfortable sweater dress  and the quality of the material seems good. the solid blue strip down the front makes it look very bland. i think it would need some dressing up with a necklace or scarf. i decided to pass.
0,More importatn  super soft matieral and comfortbale  hwoever  when i put it on  ilfelt like i was wearing a robe... i do like the detial in the fabric  but jsut dind't feel right as cardigan. maybe purchase if you are looking for a light robe.    true to size  tried on xs  maybe petite would work too.
-1,Really wanted to luv this top buttt it ran small in arm length & in the front  bottom...backside was perfect coverage...also most important this top is see-through! item as pictured is not accurate!
0,Without seeing the 'online exclusive' notation  i went into my local retailer store to try on this sweater because sometimes i wear small and sometimes a medium. once the very helpful retailer employee looked it up and advised they don't carry it in stores  i ordered it at the check-out desk in a size medium. i was so excited with anticipation because i love stripes and i love the color gray... this sweater was right up my alley. i was very disappointed when i decided to return it. first of all  i d
-1,This is a beautiful sweater with deep rich colors. i purchased the blue motif. the problem is that the model(s) are small busted  which allows the side panels and front panel to lay nicely and swing in a flattering manner. i am 5'6''  135 pounds and a 36d. i usually wear a small in antro tops. i purchased this online  and was excited upon it's arrival. when i tried it on  i was horrified. it looked like a babydoll maternity sweater on me. the front did not lay well (flat) at all from the chest d
-1,"This skirt looks cute online but  it has several issues. 1.) the slit is very high  this photo is deceptive  look closely...the slit is actually to her finger tips. you cant wear any kind of spanx or control top tights. 2.) slits on both sides so when you walk they fly away. 3.) the micro mini ""slip"" bunches. 4.) the fine knit is very snag-able. 5.) the skirt is very long. it is going back."
-1,"Maybe it's because i'm 40  but this top was underwhelming. i felt like it was a cheap tee with a big  obnoxious bow on the back. it does look cute on the model  so maybe it's a ""younger"" top. i would have felt silly wearing it."
0,I was so ready to love this dress but it runs extremely small - like you should maybe purchase a size 2 sizes bigger than what you normally wear.
1,This jumper is so cute  it is soft  and you can dress it up or down depending on where your going.
-1,The shape is awkward  too loose  not flattering. my body just disappears under all the fabric and the bird print wasn't as cute as online. returning this one.
1,Great shirt  more of a stretch to it than i thought it would. very flowy  looks great with jeans & leggings.
-1,Luckily i bought this on sale... i now see the instructions online say to hand wash  but i bought mine in the store. the instructions on the tag said to wash delicate in cold water and tumble dry. i washed it in cold water and it shrunk to doll size.
1,I received this dress as a gift and it has become such a great addition to my wardrobe! i love that i can wear it to work and then out with friends. a great value if you're looking for one special piece that you can get miles out of - you can wear the two pieces separate or together. i love floral and felt this non traditional take on a floral was very refreshing.
-1,I ordered a small from the online shop knowing it would be drapey  but it's much more than drapey. and the front draping looks like halloween costume material - not chic or sophisticated. sadly  i will be returning this top.
