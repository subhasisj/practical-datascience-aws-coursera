0,Wish i'd noticed that the sleeve cuff and hem were 'cut' to look hippie-casual. i'm taking this back with great regret. it's soft and the prettiest pale lime-sherbet color; made for a cool summer look. i don't like 'tattered ' though - so back it goes. sigh. it's soft  true fit  and beautiful. i'd buy it in many colors and in the lovely lavender print if it wasn't for the 'cuts.'
0,I didn't have as much of a problem with the sheer fabric as the other reviewers  but this dress is incredibly long and large  especially compared to the picture. for reference  i'm usually a 4/6 in retailer dresses and the small was huge on me  particularly on the bottom half. i was very disappointed because this dress looks so cute online!
1,The tie neck is super on trend. this will go great under a jacket or cardi. it's a keeper.
1,This shirt is super soft and comfortable! luckily it's a good length and not at all short!
0,This is a lot shinier in person  and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size. there is a hi-lo hem going on that doesn't flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side. due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band  it can get crumply on the side if you don't get the right size. the material feels a little thin and scratchy.
-1,Although i love retailer  this product isn't the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric wasn't soft and fluid as i expected  but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version  which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking.
1,Good quality shirt. cute design and not sheer. not quite as loose and stretchy as most of retailer's shirt  but good fit.
1,I loved this at first sight  and ordered it in a 10  12  and 14 to make sure i'd get one that fit me. (i ended up with the 12). i wear a 32 dd bra  so usually braless is not an option  but this actually offers enough support. and  if i do want to wear a bra it's got a well placed strap across the back that will cover it.     it's super flattering  and really fun to wear out day or night.
1,I wore this with a velvet moss-colored skirt (also sold at retailer) that hits above knee and received so many compliments. the neckline and sleeves are gorgeous. i like my sweaters comfy so i ordered a medium and love it. not quite cropped but it does hit a bit higher on the waist. sleeves hit above wrist as well.
-1,This romper is cute  well-made and true to size  but i haven't figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties. which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on. not sure what the designers were thinking here. i'm returning this one.
0,"I love this top. it is very short and hits at a potentially unflattering area if one has wider hips. the fabric and swing to the ""skirt"" is adorable."
-1,This is an extremely flattering dress. i couldn't resist buying it  even though i didn't come into the store looking for a dressier dress  which i feel this is. once i tried it on  i had to purchase it. its one of those things that i know i won't regret because at some point  an occasion will show up that i'll wear it to. its soft  comfy and flowing and accentuates the body's curves without being too tight or clingy. its a classic!
1,This dress hits all of the high notes for me. it is crisp  elegant  and it looks like something a european coutour designer would create. i am so glad i have this dress in my wrardrobe. it hits me just above the knee which is super flattering. wear this to a fancy party when you want to look feminine and classy. it is a dress that will serve you for a lifetime.
0,These ran true to size  but the fabric is very stiff and unforgiving. i'm athletic and have lean legs  but these seemed to cling to and roll on every dimple on my thigh. and sitting down was uncomfortable at the knees because of the stiff fabric. i loved how they fit at the waist  but the legs just didn't work for me. sadly returning these.
-1,This sweater was just okay. i am happy to pay $100 or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy  and not the quality i expected for that price. i may have kept it if it were at about half the price  but it just was not worth it. retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less. i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer. looked great in the photos  but unfortunately in person were not quality garments.
0,I ordered this online and was surprised to see yellow in the pattern when it arrived. i can't see that in the online photo. i didn't like the pattern at all when i saw it for real. the shirt is very loose  fits much like the model photo (i ordered a small  5'6 140lbs). just looks kind of frumpy and the pleat down the front makes the front hang heavily.
1,"Only thing is the fit is a little loose  so i wish the xxs petite wasn't sold out (or that there was a xxs#. at 115 lbs  i tried on e xs regular  that made the skirt a maxi on me #5'1.5""# and it was nice  but a bit loose. i would have worn it as a sexy strapless #i tried it  just not daring enough to actually wear it like that). so i ordered the xs petite  we shall see.    the navy and beige is a nice classy combo  i could see it being pulled off in all seasons  depending how you pair it."
-1,"I bought this online with the intention of it being my graduation dress. i'm 5'2""  115 pounds so i should've known better and gotten a ""petite"" style dress. however  i loved the modern look of this and since my boobs are a bit bigger (34d) i figured they would help fill it out. upon receiving the dress  i was first shocked that for the price  the construction was pretty poor quality: there were strings coming out of the straps and they looked unevenly sewn. when i put it on  it was clear that th"
-1,"First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly  it has a really funky  cheap  unfinished  raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again  does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5'5"" 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t"
-1,"Tried this on at my local retailer  the red color is pretty but not a ""true"" red. the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days. two big problems though- the top is very low cut and i could see it ""opening"" up to the world! and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra  this is a deal-breaker for me  it can't be fixed."
0,Beautiful top  the silk was good quality  not thin. ordered a 6 because it was selling out so quickly  wished i could have ordered the 4. will definitely try if they come back in stock.
0,I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes  the top and bottoms fit overall  but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work  which i am willing to work on s
0,Very pretty  romantic
1,This dress is perfect and so sweet! i do agree with other reviewers in that it runs about 1/2 to one size large. i run anywhere from 6-8 in retailer dresses and i ordered the 6. if you are usually in between sizes definitely order the smaller size. the smaller size also allows me to go braless even though i have a larger (34dd) chest because of the well-constructed bodice. length is nice for us tall girls as well!!
0,I wanted to love the stress so much i mean who doesn't love polkadots and a good maxi! unfortunately the fit was too awkward. the bust is saggy and the waist seems to poof out
0,Beautiful and good quality dress. the pictures nor the description really show or mention the keyhole cut at the front neckline.  you really have to look very closely at the model photos to see it.  unlike the model  i have curves and this dress showed way too much cleavage for me.
0,I had read a few reviews on this shirt before ordering that said it ran small and was shorter than it looks. i thought it was worth finding out because i really liked how this shirt looks in the pictures on the store site. unfortunately  when i got it in the mail and opened it up i found out that all the earlier review were right.    it is much shorter than the dimensions implied in the pictures of the model. i was expecting a tunic style shirt that could be worn over leggings or skinny jeans th
0,I really wanted to like this shirt but it doesn't seem to be of that great of quality and is much more sheer than indicated in the photographs. the shirt is very clingy and doesn't hang well. i sent it back
-1,This sweater is very long  could be worn as a dress at 5'3 !
1,I tried these on in the store and didn't buy them with the other items in my 'yes' pile. i couldn't stop thinking about them and ended up ordering them. they are so cute. the fabric is a nice weight. they have little stretch.
1,I purchased this top in the store  intending only to go in and return two tops i purchased on sale that did not fit. i had been looking for a red top to wear with navy  and this one couldn't have looked more perfect on the hanger. from the front  it looks pretty traditional  but the back is just gorgeous! the multi-colors and the pleating give the top a lot of interest and depth. the fabric is also super soft and comfortable. the top does run quite large  though  as i purchased an xs and still h
0,I love this suit! the pattern is just lovely. unfortunately i have to return the suit because i can't wear it. there are no cups or pads or underwire for the chest. you have to look like the model wearing the suit to wear this. if you need any support than give up. who can wear an xl and not have some breasts at all? the neckline is also very low and ended up revealing the top half of my breasts.    the birds of paradise are just lovely  not exactly the same on every suit  but still nice. i just
-1,I really wanted to like this jump suit.  i rarely have problem with retailer clothing.  i'm 5.6  hourglass shape  usually wear size 2.  this jumpsuit runs small  but that's not the only problem.  top part (shirt piece of the jumpsuit) is too short  so it's digging into my lady part.  the color does not look anything like the picture  so overall this piece is failure.  i hope that i find something similar but fits better.
0,I didn't realize it had a tie around the waist. it seems too much material hanging in the front to tie at the waist. unfortunately the sash is attached and cannot be removed. it's very cute; just not for me.  i will have to return (but sure i can find something else)!
1,Great quality and extremely flattering. bonus that it is on sale. i felt like this dress was a godsend. i am five months pregnant and needed a dress that made me feel comfortable but not frumpy. i think i'll get a lot of mileage out of it  as there's enough stretch to get me through the next few months and then (hopefully!) i can wear it after too. also can be dressed up or down  so appropriate for many occasions. i believe it runs true to size (i sized up  from xs to s  for obvious reasons  but
-1,This top has a nice design. i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape. if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist. however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank. it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area  which i could have easily fixed. it is very sheer; even with a nude bra  my bra was too visible for my comfort. plan on wearing a full camisole underneath  tank  or bralette you are fine with being on display.
-1,"This style is right up my alley and i was excited to receive it. however  it is seriously overpriced. i ordered the white and the material is thin and see-through. the small was even a bit roomy (5'7""  140lbs  32dd). going back unfortunately."
1,"I bought this shift dress for a ""black & plaid"" nye event  and it fit the bill perfectly for a cold winter's night. looks great with tights and boots  has pockets  and dresses up nicely. i like a good shift at this point in the holiday season -- leaves room for that last bit of seasonal eating and drinking. looking forward to wearing this through the winter months."
0,I thought this was so cute online  sweet and feminine  but when it arrived and i tried it on in my usual 12p i felt like i had just stepped back into freshman year of highschool - it is very early 90s - not the bohemian i was going for. it is also very high waisted  even for my little 5'1 frame. i truly felt like they pulled this out of someone's closet  dusted it off and said  ta da! as much as i love rachel and monica i have moved on from their clothing :)
-1,The reason for the title above is this skirt doesn't wow me. i felt like i could find this anywhere  and i don't go to retailer for such things. they have definitely mainstreamed more and more over the years....  __________  pros:  - tts. i tried on a large (and i'm normally either a 10 or 12) and it fit well and hung well on my hourglass and wider hips without billowing out.  - flows nicely! it does have a great movement to it.  - a good everyday skirt.  - not sheer at all. it is lined.  - when y
0,There is nothing special about this skirt. it's plain and incredibly dowdy looking. long and wide. i am usually between a small and medium. after reading the other review that said the waist ran small i went with a medium. it fit fine in the waist/hips.
1,Beautiful cobalt blue dress. i wore it for christmas and had many compliments.
-1,"I'm happy the other reviewers made this dress work because it looked terrible on me. i'm 5 9"" and 128 lbs and it made me look like i had gained 25 lbs. as others have said  the pockets make the dress even worse-it's very hard to get them to lay flat. the material is lovely  soft and i liked the gray color  but this dress made me feel like i was wearing something from an asylum."
-1,This item is pretty  the print on the fabric is nice and reminiscent of embroidery  but only the top portion has a few embroidered accents. my issue with it is it's very impractical. the fabric is extremely thin  and you wouldn't want to wear it in any weather below 75 degrees. it's ridiculous to advertise this product for a fall/winter season. the tube top underneath doesn't work very hard to stay up  and isn't a very practical way to hold up the jumpsuit (why wouldnt they just stitch a lining
-1,I was really disappointed with these pants. they were a thinner fabric than expected with little to no stretch. they were very tight around my legs and huge at the waist. sadly  they will be going back.
-1,I agree with the other review. the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made. the fabric is not sheer at all and great quality;however  the shirt is very wide. i am a 34/26/36 and the small is way too big. the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance.
-1,This dress is gorgeous as displayed at store. color is vibrant  but the one i ordered looked dull and wrinkles very easily. i wore it to a ceremony and the seatbelt left me wrinkled before i arrived. the top is very wide and best to wear strapless.
0,This dress is lovely (albeit darker than it appears on the website)  but i had to return. it runs way small?i usually comfortably where an l or xl in maeve (this brand)  and could not even get this l on. would really only recommend for xs or s ladies (maybe m) who have the possibility of going larger. if you do purchase  absolutely size up 1-2 sizes.
0,"I so wanted to love this dress! the fabric is gorgeous the styling beautiful and the construction is great - however  the armholes are cut too generously. i am 5'4""  138 pounds and 36d. i ordered the black in a size 10. it fit me perfectly everywhere but the armholes. even with an undergarment  too much is exposed. i am sadly returning this."
-1,I wanted to like this top  as the fabric was nice and thick  but found that it dipped too low beneath the armpits  which would be ok if your lats are in perfect shape  but i've always found that cut made mine look a bit saggy (and i'm not heavy). not great enough to keep in my opinion.
1,This dress is adorable! it fits loose and is not at all fitted  with the exception of the under cami lining. the picture showing front and back is being pulled to fit. :/ it fits like the model wearing the purple. my local store was out of my normal size so i sized up which really made no difference at all. the biggest difference would be the under cami. the dress is flowy and airy. one of the best casual dresses retailer has had in a long time. obviously  the blue is sold out till may. this can b
1,"This cardigan can be dressed up with leggings and booties or dressed down with jeans and chucks. i love the fit of the small (5''3"" and small/medium build). would highly recommend for a dinner out or lounging around at home."
-1,Very sheer inexpensive material. even on sale i'm returning it
1,I ordered a size up after reading the reviews  but i wouldn't of had to. it's not a snug fit at all. although  i am fairly small busted. soft fabric with a little stretch that will be great for lounging around the house or running errands.
-1,The top looks better on the model than in-person. it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly. i don't like the sleeve length or the top style  it just didn't look flattering or good. i am sending it back. looks very boxy.
1,"I love this dress  it is very photo friendly which is a big plus for me. i am not the tallest person  5'4"" but i had to be careful not to get my sleeves in the food i was preparing. perhaps the sleeve length is a bit longer on me  but i had to be very cautious while trying to put the finishing touches on our holiday feast. it's just something to be aware of. i suggest sushi or a nice cheese plate if you want to wear it as the hostess."
-1,Super soft fabric  however very short in the stride. i ordered an xl  normally wear 12/14.  i had to return it.
0,"The dress immediately caught my eye in the store. upon trying it on  i discovered that the slip runs extremely small (and unnecessarily so considering the looseness of the shift). the skirt is a tad long--i'm 5'6"" and it hits mid-knee. it's a shame the slip was so tight--i loved the dress otherwise."
1,For cat lovers in particular  these socks will grab your attention. they are fine quality ankle socks. the kittens are really more moss green than beige.
0,I believe that this sweater is by moth and not knitted and knotted as noted in the description. for me  this tunic was just ok. i didn't think that the quality was great and it just didn't wow me  especially at this price point.
1,As cute in person as the picture shows. good quality  worth the money!
-1,A good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes. i mix them with my basics  scarves and jewelry. so  i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses  even though i felt it was pretty pricey. when it arrived  i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric. it does nothing for any of my intended clothes  so it is going back asap.
-1,Even at a very deep discount  this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it  but as i discovered when it arrived  that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for
-1,Top is completely see through. i cant imagine if it were to get wet what it would look like. it is a cute design but not practical at all.
0,"I likded this but tried it in two sizes and it was still too big in the armpit. my bra showed. i am about a d cup  smallish in other proportions (125  5'6"") and no bra worked with this so that i wouldn't have to worry about my bra showing. nice fabric and drape. maybe good for someone who doesn't need a bra?"
1,I stumbled upon the blue version in the store. i immediately liked that it was easy  chic  and just different-enough. after wearing it for a birthday dinner  i saw it online and realized that i had styled it almost exactly the same way the blue one is shown. black sandal wedges  silver cuff  silver earrings. it is flattering in an unexpected way  which may be partially because i am really small-chested. the front v is deep compared to what i usually wear  but double-sided tape easily kept my bra
1,This cardigan is a beautiful - not too thin  but soft and versatile. the cutouts add a nice unique detail. i was worried that the cuts might fray  but they actually have a very thin bit of glue to prevent fraying. really beautiful piece for those of us with cold summer offices :)
1,Beautiful fabric  great quality  fits true to size. love them!
0,I was looking forward to receiving this dress. i am tired of all of the swing dresses - most of which are not flattering on my petite frame. i am also uncomfortable with dresses that fall much above the knee as i am somewhat older. the colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful. vibrant  but not too bright. when i got it on i was thrilled with the fit - until i looked at the back. there are pleats at the waist in back and there is way too much fabric. it looked like i had a bustle under the d
1,"Beautiful dress  skims the body perfectly and flatters. the silky and breathable fabric is everything-- it's made of cupro (used as a silk substitute but breathes like cotton-- uniqlo uses it in their ""airism"" products which makes it perfect for summer weather!). i wore it to a summer barbecue  dressed down with a denim shirt tied at the waist and simple jewelry  but can easily dress it up with a chunky heeled sandal and statement jewelry. it's gorgeous-- get it!       the colors of the fabric a"
0,First off  the other reviews are spot on regarding the quality of this top. the material is thick and pleasant feeling  the print is beautiful and the construction is nicely done. however  i just couldn't get past the fit issue  which was also mentioned by the other reviewers. i ordered a 14 for my 38 dd chest  and it was loose in all the wrong places. i'd be interested to see what a 12 looks like on me  but i'm afraid it would be too snug. this may look awesome on someone else  but i had to ret
