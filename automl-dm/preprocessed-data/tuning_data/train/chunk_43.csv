-1,I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however  this shirt is so unstructured and oversized  i might as well worn a brown paper bag.
-1,I'm 5'4  115 and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie. i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if you're 5'8 and above? it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm  body and skirt. a belt was no match for that much fabric. the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made  but the design was awful.
0,I'm normally a 10/12 and ordered the m/l. the body was a little big but ok. the arms are really wide. there are snaps to make them tighter but it doesn't do much. i do like the embroidery. it's an ok jacket but the fit could have been better.
-1,I was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed  not the same colors as the picture  spandex material  the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped. i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress.
1,"Fell in love with this sweater the minute i saw it. the crocheted front is stunning. the small fit perfectly  5'5""  36c. i am usually between a small and medium so if a small is usually roomy you may want to size down. it's a medium weight  soft and comfortable  not at all itchy. perfect for dressing up or down. look forward to many years of use from this fun  classic style cardigan."
1,This could worn with anything. tank top  long sleeves  gloves  jeans and pants. very high quality material. will be a staple in my wardrobe this fall!!!
-1,Wanted to love this dress  bit it wasn't to be. strange fit  and doesn't drape nicely  as in the photo. also  the blue color was much darker in person. wouldn't recommend.
0,If you're tall  this dress sits up too high-waisted and this makes your waist look big. it's also kind of thin material on top and stretchy  so even though i'm small chested it made my shoulders and chest look large  but not on a good way. in other words  this dress made me look fat. the length is not bad for taller gals. all in all  not worth it.
0,I wish i could keep this dress based on the pretty orange print and style but the fabric and details make this a return  even on sale price :( agree with previous reviews: bodice too tight  neckline too high/chokes  fabric is rough  outer is poorly attached to liner so it poofs in weird areas. too bad...so sad!
-1,I thought this would be a cute business attire skirt. i hate to say it  but i felt like it flared out as if i were amelia bedelia or some whacky children's book character and not retailer. the fabric made it look bulky. i sadly had to return it.
0,Wanted to love this one so badly but didn't work for me. just looks really wide on me -- looks amazing on the model though!
1,I liked this sweater in the picture but was less impressed when i saw it in the store. it looked a bit odd and perhaps cheap to me. still i decided to leave it on my wish list and got it as a christmas gift. once i tried it on  i really liked the way it looked and felt! it's flattering  comfortable and looks great with jeans! it's really cozy! i rated it tts but you could almost size down on it.
1,I ordered this top in xs and blue  its subtle but pretty on  as the style gives it a boost. it is a bit snug in the shoulders (cut a little snug in armpit?) but i would not want it larger. it does not affect the appearance  is not uncomfortable  just noticeable when moving arms around. nice fall top  want to try with blue or white jeans and boots.
0,Love the color and design but way to small. i can wear a small in many manufacturers but certainly not in this one. the medium was like an extra small. sorry because i liked what i saw in the advertisement. as an older lady i love your well made  fresh  styles but need to be able to trust that a size is true to form.
0,Interesting  slightly transparent fabric. neckline is not so open as pictured. body is boxier than pictured.  would recommend as a maybe.
1,This shirt looked so perfect on the model  and i was so excited to get it! when i received it  it was so soft and the color was so vibrant. the only thing is  it's too big. it kind of looks like a maternity shirt. it will definitely have to be taken in on the sides for me  but i'm happy with it other than that. i'm normally a l/xl but m would have been perfect this time.
1,This is my favorite dress purchase so far in 2016. the fabric feel and thickness is wonderful. it flares out a little but not too much. order the size that matches your largest measurement on the size chart for bust and waist  - or if you have broad shoulders  the larger of your typical size range. i'm typically a 00p or a 0p  with a 00p hip measurement  a middle range (00p is 24  0p is 25) waist measument (24.5) and a 00p bust measurement  but my shoulders are broad and athletic. 0p  the larger
-1,"I ordered these pants after seeing the good reviews  but i don't agree. these are going back. i ordered a small. i'm 5'5"" and 135 pounds. i am usually between a small and a medium in pants  but the small in these pants is huge. i could definitely fit into an xs. but i also don't think they are very flattering and don't like the feel of the fabric. it's too bad. i love the idea of these."
1,An adorable tank...wearing it right now!  fits this curvy girl well  though may consider wearing a tank underneath  as the keyhole does show a bit of cleavage.  if in between sizes  consider sizing down.  perfect print for summer.
-1,I read the other review that said the shirt was boxy  i didn't think it would be a terribly big deal. unfortunately  it is. normally i wear a size s  so i sized down o an xs. the shirt fits in the sleeves and neckline  but the shirt is still very box and now super short. unfortunately  this is going back. not a good fit. adorable details but the fit is terrible.
1,Cute and simple.  nice fabric. it's a looser fit so if you're in between sizes i'd recommend the smaller size
1,Love this top. great twist on a traditional plaid. looks great with skinny jeans or leggings. i get compliments on it every time i wear it.
-1,This open cardigan runs really big and has way too much fabric. even going down a size i felt like i was swimming in it.
-1,Let me start off by saying that i really  really wanted this jumpsuit to work as it looked good on me and was tts (got a 6p). unfortunately  it didn't work out due to the two buttons at the top which break way too easily. i had to return it and exchange for another jumpsuit but it did me no good as the second one did the very same thing so i didn't even bother trying it on. the buttons broke through before i even got the chance as the material is far too thin and the back of the buttons just pop
0,"How can some reviewers say this jacket is true to size  yet others say it runs small? i think it's because this jacket is cropped. by the time i took advantage of the fall perks 20 percent discount  the xs peach was sold out so i ended up ordering size s. i also got the xs gray to compare. sure enough  the xs looks better but is cropped on me. for ref  i'm 5' 5""  32a  115 lbs. i don't really need another almost black jacket so i'm either sized out or have to exchange for xs peach to wear with dr"
0,This top is much stiffer  more baby-doll and boxier than pictured. lining is stiff too  and colors more muddy than shown. i wear boho tops all the time and this looked terrible on me (i have broad-ish shoulders and a chest). i thought it would be a fun  drapey top for transition to fall but unfortunately it's going back.
-1,I am so sad i have to return these leggings. they're adorable--so much so that my fiancã© commented favorably on them--but as other reviewers have pointed out  there's no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they'll fall down! why  sleeping on snow? whyyyyyyyyyyy? they're so great otherwise!
1,Ordered my regular size s early this week and was thrilled to receive them yesterday. they fit just as expected and are quite comfortable. i would definitely recommend them as a nice alternative to pajamas or even as a slip.
-1,This top is very soft and well made. for my short and curvy figure  it is very unflattering. i considered altering it  but there is no way to do it. it gapes in the front and if you have a waist at all  it won't show because this top is boxy and full in that area. if you are tall and slim  it might be perfect  so give it a try.
-1,I bought this top thinking i would wear this and feel like i was part of some fashion week  but it's cut way too large that i felt like a football player. this top is made for women with small shoulders and a super petite frame. also  the cut is way too big. i was swimming in this.
1,The picture online doesn't do this pretty dress justice. i'm curvy  and always searching for dresses that don't make me look like a sack of potatoes. its pin tucks at the bust give it a little shape  and the print is much more vibrant in person. will look great with tights and a black blazer for dinners out.
-1,The fit of the top is true to size  but i really don't like the taupe terrycloth-like sweatshirt under the white lace. the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy  but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe. it is terrible paired together. i also didn't like the feel of the terrycloth-like fabric against my skin. even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail  i'm absolutely sending it back.
0,So this shirt is adorable. soft  fun  lays nicely...  but you should have your arms amputated and replaced with a barbie's before you put it on.   i don't even have large arms  the medium fit me perfectly  but then like i hulked out the arms and there are now little tears at the seams. this was all very confusing and vexing as this shirt is otherwise perfection.     i mean  i'm not a large? but i guess if i want this shirt  i will need to take it back and get a large  otherwise  it will be sleev
-1,I really like this dress/shirt. it's great for layering  super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this year's pregnancy weight gain. i think it will be so cute with some leggings and boots.  unfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size. this may sound weird but i've tried on an 8 and a 10 and the ability to reach forward didn't change between the two sizes. i just returned the 10 and am hopeful the 12 i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back.
-1,I ordered this and hoped it would be a fun & whimsical sweater for this winter. instead  it's just strange. it didn't fit well. too short in the overall length & in the sleeves. the shades of the yarn were drab. it also didn't seem made to last. it looked like it would pill/snag in a short amount of time. i returned it. i'd love to see a style similar to this executed better in the future. having a unique sleeve is a cute idea.
0,Wonderful pencil skirt with subtle design to pair with a variety of tops or sweaters. fabric is nice and has a true 'fitted' design. however  the sizing is all off. it runs small and too long. i'm 5'3 and wait 25/26 in denim and a 2-4p in most skirts. the 4 is too tight and past the knee in length. more like upper calf. the 6 would be way too long. disappointed.
0,I am on the fence about this top. i like the color but i'm not sure what to make of the style. the top part of it  around the chest and straps is lovely and flattering  but the bottom flairs out way more than i like. the back is longer than the front and it's almost a pregnancy top in how much it flairs. it's also quite thin and flimsy material given how expensive it is  even with the tag sale. the color  pattern and the chest part of the top is nice enough that i may keep this one  but  as i sa
-1,I have other stevies  and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist  approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally  the cuff is sewn like that in place  and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like  a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!
1,I purchased this shirt in black. luckily  it was on sell. it can be dressed up or dressed down. it's so easy to just throw this on with skinny pants or jeans. i got it on sale too. i just hope that i can keep it for years since it will always be in style.
-1,They look nice on the page  but they didn't work on my body. made me look big and boxy. maybe if you're super-skinny  they'll be fine.
0,"I tried this on in my usual xs (5'5""  128lbs) and it fit like a dream. i was instantly in love. until i looked from the side and realized it was cut up way too short. i have a longer torso and shorter legs and this came up past my finger tips if i stood with my arms down. no way could i wear this as a dress. as a tunic definitely though  but i was really hoping to find a nice  versatile fall dress. it was a let down but i still may consider purchasing it because the material was so soft and it f"
0,I ordered this dress after seeing it styled with a beautiful cape.  when it arrived  it was incredibly soft and the color was a pretty  muted pink.  however  once i put it on  it clinged to all the wrong places.  having a larger chest made it show a lot of cleavage and if i can't wear a standard bra with it  it's too complicated.  in a regular tank dress  it would have been a yes. overall a great dress  but probably for another body type.
-1,"Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me  if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also  for the price  material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2""  114#  34b"
-1,Fight a bit snug over the bust then widens like a bell. not as cute as it looks in the photo. returned.
1,It is a perfect weight and length. it's a great dress. i did need to have the waist altered bc it is a straight fit.
0,You guys  i love this so much! however  within one hour of wearing it  the back seam completely ripped. it fit me perfectly... sadly i&#39;ll have to return the damaged item. really sad it&#39;s all sold out too!
1,I love these pilcro cropped chinos. i ordered them in the sand and will be ordering them in the grey. they are very soft and comfortable
1,These legging are adorable. i love that i was able to get them in a petite size and the detailing of these pants are awesome. the buttons at the ankle are cute. i truly feel these leggings are worth the price i paid for them because normally i don't like to spend so much on leggings.
1,I love this dress. i read the reviews on it before i purchased and they were spot on. i have broad shoulders so i ordered the large. it was still plenty roomy but i wore a royal blue sweater with it and it pulled the waist in just enough to make it fit without a belt. i would buy it again!!
-1,How cute was this little sweater and comfortable even in the south .... until i washed it! i followed the instructions on the label being careful not to wring it out. first of all  the smell was unbelievable! i washed it three days ago and it is still wet and damp and on top of that  it shrunk. even though i handwashed it  line dried it and pampered it to no end!
0,"First  i love wool. if it's 100% wool  i love it. if wool isn't your thing  then this dress isn't for you. i ordered this dress online in the burgundy. it is not itchy. it falls above my knees and i am 5'3"". it is warm and cozy with pockets  which i love. with the sleeves being short  i am wearing a long  frilly cardigan over it. i ordered the small (did not notice a size chart with this product). i am usually a size 4 or 6. it fits great in the bodice  but runs large through the hips. however "
1,Saw these in the store and had to have them. i wear them rolled up. they are lightweight. whenever i wear them i want to smile. the birds with hats are so funny. i wear them to run errands  have worn them when flying  etc. can't say enough good things about these pants. they wash well  no ironing needed.
0,This is a beautiful skirt; the colors are fresh and summery  yet subtle  and it's a nice sturdy cotton  not flimsy and cheap looking. however  i agree with the reviewer who said that this runs small. i take a 4 in most skirts  but i had to try on a 6 and still felt that it didn't fit quite right. if you're extremely thin  this might be great for you.
-1,Cute skirt but i agree with the other reviewer. you can't get it on! i tried my skinny daughter tried no go!
0,Customers beware  there is no lining on this dress. i love the pattern however it would be a nightmare trying to find a slip to match the dress! i ordered it on line but i'll take it back to the shop.
0,I have the blue and gray and love the look and feel. however  the gray within days ripped at the seam and other areas.
1,This skirt is so cute!! highly recommend  super easy to dress up or to dress down. it isn't shown as well in the picture but it has really intricate and pretty detailed stitching throughout the skirt. i have gotten so many compliments on it  random people have even stopped to tell me how much they like it and where they can find it. it runs a little small so i recommend buying it a size up. also  if you're taller like me it is a little short in the back. overall  a great buy!
-1,This shirt looks nothing like the fit in the pictures. it is short and very wide. i had read the previous reviews and thought i could take it in on the sides some but it is literally the shape of a trapezoid.
0,After seeing this dress online and noticing how quickly it sold out  i was curious about it  but thought i was out of luck. it just so happened that i ran into the store and they had one returned in my size. i tried it and wasn't sold. however  i loved the color. it was snug across the shoulders and arms. the rest was somewhat flowy  but boxy at the same time. i ended up bringing it home to think on it. after trying it on again  i realized the snugness across the shoulder really caused the top t
1,These are my new favorite jeans. the gray wash is nice  and the distressing is subtle enough that i can wear these to work. the rise is high enough that i don't need to worry about bending over but not so high that they get near my belly button. and the description is true: they don't stretch! i'm a loyal ag stevie shopper  and the fit on these is similar... just a little skinnier in the ankles  maybe. true to size. a little long  so i'll probably hem them a couple of inches.
0,"I bought the rose and the sapphire during the xtr 40% off clearance. i'm just under 5'4""  curvy & usually wear med petite in retailer dresses. i ordered a mr because  being sale items  only regular sizing was available. a sp would have been much better! the dress hit about 3"" below my knee and the crisscross top made my bust look matronly. a snugger fit would have been sexier. the rose was darker than pictured & pretty  but eh on me. however  the sapphire was gorgeous. i'm sad about returning it."
1,I love this jess. i got it in the blue gray color  and i think it's going to be great for spring and will work into summer as well. cloth and stone is always one of my favorite brands and this dress is so soft. i'm thinking that i'm going to belt it to give it some more shape but i like how it looks unbelted as well
0,The blouse was not flattering on me. it would be for someone with a straight slim body type  it falls mid hips and so it accentuates my hips making them look larger. it's flared so it cannot really be tucked in.
1,It's hard to go wrong with the charlie's  especially in this fabric  keep them coming!! i wrote a review on the brush strokes as well. they fit pretty true to size  i'd say try both your usual size and one size down as well  they stretch out a little  so if they feel a little tight keep that in mind. because of the texture of these pants you can wear so many more colors than just usual black and white trouser fabric. try wearing a burnt orange  green  or pink (the isabella sinclair grid wrap but
1,"These pants are great. i am 5'6"" and 133lbs. i normally wear medium for athletic bottoms. medium fits well except knee pit area. maybe because they are not very stretching fabric. however  they are still flattering. the material was thick enough and their print hides underwear lines."
0,"I love the style and color of this jumpsuit. i ordered a petite  and with tall shoes  it's still about 3"" too long. the side seam needs to be taken out at the bottom to hem it  so that's a pain in the rear.   also  this has a side zipper  but you step through the neckline to put it on. if any part of me was even a tiny bit larger  this would never work.   the biggest issue is that it armholes/bust gaps a lot. there should have been a dart from the armhole down towards the bust. i'm hoping to be"
0,My girlfriend and i both purchased these leggings in grey. we love the color because it goes with so many things.the problem is they do not fit the same. hers ran true to size and mine ran small. i am tempted to reorder another pair to see if they fit differently.
0,This dress has a nice flow and it is simple but versatile. you can pair it with a jacket or cardigan for the winter and use it year round. however it runs one size large.
-1,I wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan. unfortunately  however  i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach. the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger.  the quality seemed okay  but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long.
1,I loved the layered look without all the bulk. the different textures make it so interesting.
1,"Love this top! kept looking online  but really wanted to try on. so once i made it to a store  i was so happy they had my size! i'm 5'1""  but prefer regular sizes in retailer for the length. i got the xs and it is a lovely fit  tts. love the colors in the pink top!"
