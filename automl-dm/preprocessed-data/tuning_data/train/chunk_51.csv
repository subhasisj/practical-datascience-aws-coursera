1,"I just bought this and really think it is a great dress! it is conservative  and i will be able to wear it to teach or play the organ at my church. i am a church organist and college professor and need conservative clothes  yet i do not like to look ""frumpy."" this is cute and chic  yet conservative. also j got 25% because it is black friday. thank you retailer!!!"
1,Size down! i love this item. it goes perfect with leggings but if you are typically a small you would need to order an extra small and so forth. hopefully once i wash this it will shrink some.
1,I never would have thought that i could wear a jumpsuit and it actually look good on me  but this is it!!! the fabric is weighted some so it lays very flattering and is very comfortable. the sash can be tied several ways-front  back  or side. i will be traveling in this to the beach and pairing it with an retailer wrap  and then wearing it alone with sandals once we exit the freezing airplanes. a racer back bra works great with this piece and the pockets are an added bonus. it looks like a d
-1,The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however  the fabric  despite 2% spandex  has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4')  i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear  i think they would cut off the circulation.  please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.
-1,What a let down. the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured. based on the original price point  i envisioned a beautiful hand-knitted sweater made of high grade yarn/ wool that i could use for travel. instead  i received something that is grossly oversized for xs/s  made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater. my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom. not the quality i expected from retailer. back it goes.
-1,"The cut is small. i am 5'9""  150 lbs and usually wear 6-8/medium pants. medium in these is too fitted on my hips and rear.the polyester will be hot in summer. returning for another brand."
1,This jacket is beautiful in colors and warm enough to wear in the fall or layer it with a sweater in the winter. it is more taylored at the bottom at the legs and would be great with leggings or jeans. i originally ordered a large but found myself swimming in it so happy it was still available in medium so i re-ordered it. definitely order it in a size smaller. sadly it was after the sale had ended but great customer service they issued it for me at the price i originally paid. (ps i'm 8 months
0,This is a very fetching little dress but the details of the fit  as described by other reviewers  is slightly off. i am 34d 5'5 and 140 lbs. the top fits perfectly but has an odd gap at the button placket. the fabric is nice enough but not exactly as i expected. one must have a very flat stomach as the top of the dress is not forgiving at all. the dress just wasn't me  i guess  so this one is going home to retailer...
1,This top is really pretty & i think i will be happy when i pull it out in the spring to wear it. the only complaint is that the front is very sheer. you have to wear an under shirt of some kind.
0,I saw this skirt online and went to the store immediately to try on. i was a bit disappointed. the size is tts but the prints were prettier online. the material is ok. the regular is long so probably won't look good on a shorter person  if it is still available when the price comes down  i might buy it.
1,I definitely agree with the other reviewers who said this top is better suited for someone tall and slender. the design on the lace is beautiful and i love the scalloped hem. but it is somewhat boxy and flowy  which didn't seem to work on my curvy body proportion-wise.
1,This dress set my heart a-flutter  but i had quite a time figuring out the sizing. i literally ordered six different sizes  and when i put them on  they all seemed to look like a very beautifully embroidered and elegant tent. if only i could just nip it in a tiny bit at the waist! then it would look like the model does! (i actually think they probably pinned the back of the dress to get it to fit on the model).  so i played around with it and ended up putting in 2 small darts in the front. and v
0,I wanted to love this. it is so cute and the xxsp  my usual size  fit perfectly. however there was a fatal flaw in the construction. the hem was not sewn properly - very asymmetrical and lopsided. instead of a scoop like shown on the model  it was much longer on one side than the other. i thought maybe it was just how it hung on me  but i took it off and laid it on my bed and i could clearly see that it was sewn wrong. this is going back. i ordered another one (now it's on backorder)  hopefully
1,I love this top! although it is a tad big  i expected this because the moth brand usually does run a tad big. however  i am still able to wear it without any nerves that it's too big.... hope that makes sense! the navy was more lovely with my skin + hair  but the yellow was so pretty too!
0,This dress is beautiful  made with high-quality fabric  unique design and color  etc.  but it fits so weird! i am hourglass shaped so this dress seemed pretty ideal  but i just couldn't make it work. it was heavy and awkward feeling when on  the clasp at the breast would definitely not stay closed long  and would undoubtedly need replacing sooner than later. the sleeves are too fluttery and long. the dress itself is just too bulky and has too much of that beautiful fabric. maybe a really tall  s
-1,"I am 5'4"" 120lbs  got xs. it was huge on me. had to return it. very trendy  great quality  unfortunate design. not worth the money."
-1,Do not buy these pants!  the first time i washed these pants i ended up with big faded spots  and i followed the washing instructions.  i bought another pair and the same thing happened.  i'm out a bunch of money!
-1,I really wanted to love this but the cut was very wide  short  and crooked. after it was washed once  it was completely unwearable because it hung all wrong.
-1,Just recently purchased and think it's ok for the price. would never pay full on this one & that's from an retailer shopper who's purchased plenty at full price. design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color  so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly  the pockets bunch up weirdly (steaming/laundering don't help) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly. could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didn't help that issue either.
-1,I just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big - i wear an 8 in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine - this one does not even zip up. i might exchange for bigger size  as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent - or it may just go back.
1,These culottes are beautiful! really pretty cerise shade with a nice eyelet pattern. they are only partially lined. the size small  my normal size  was falling off of me so i sized down to extra small which fit perfectly.
-1,I've been wearing these shorts for years  i work outside and it was great to have comfortable jean shorts that were just the perfect length. the fabric quality on these shorts (and many many other retailer items) has gone down. sure  they're great when you try them on in the store..soft  comfortable  flattering  but when these are worn for a day they get so stretched out that i feel like i need a belt to keep them on. i wore these several times  sat down on a relatively smooth concrete wall  and a
-1,I drooled over this dress online  so couldn't pass up trying it on at my local retailer store. while i loved the unique color in person  & the drape of the skirt (good quality  fully lines)  i was so disappointed with the top of this dress! it's very tight  ill-fitting  & just plain...weird. i can't imagine the fit of the top being flattering on anyone  regardless of chest size. it's a shame  because otherwise  the dress is adorable!
1,I liked this coat but my family said it looked too much like something hilary clinton would wear. i am 54 and i think it made me look a bit dowdy since it runs a bit big.
0,While the cut  drape  and shape of this dress are very attractive  seeing the fabric in person was disappointing to me. it's clearly well-made and there are abundant high-quality details. however  the combination of a large-ish pattern and the wrinkly  thin cotton still felt kind of limp and cheap. i sent it back.
0,Tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split  so any movement reveals most of your arm  shoulders. which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office (yes  i could wear a sweater or blazer with it  but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top.) why  retailer? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc.  but the split sleeves make it a no-go.
-1,Too full of a dress for me. i tried a belt and it is then too chunky. if you are younger  tall and slim  this would look great
-1,As another reviewer wrote.. this is not the same jean featured on the website. same cut and style but it's a light denim wash with wiskering and worn look at the knees. i called customer service to see if this was a mistake and they said there was not really a way to check it unless i exchanged them. i didnt want the same wrong jeans again so i opted out ... too bad they are cure.
-1,"The other reviews seemed promising and so i ordered these in a 10 petite. i am 5'4"" and the length was still long and would either need to be worn with a heel or altered. the length was not what made me send them back though. the quality is very very nice and the fabric thick  stretchy and well made. however  the body hugging fit and flare make these look exactly like a yoga pant but made from nice material. if i were a bit more confident to wear these outside of the gym then they would be great"
1,"Snapped this sweet puppy up at my local retailer-in the sale room!!!!! it is beyond fabulous and the coral color is divine!!!! brightens up the drearriest of days-i did size down. i am short and the small sleeves were way too long on my 5ft3in frame. it runs a bit large but if you were to wear a heavier something under it i could see getting your ""normal"" size. the quality is great and the style is just lovely. great jacket-love love love"
0,A lot of reviewers have been saying that this dress is simply too busy to be wearable and they're right! i love the cut and fit of this dress but don't love the style. the awesome stylist at my retailer told me to take off the belt and then try it on with a ribbon ( like the one on the charisma sheath) and it was so much more cute. it completely changed the look of the dress and made it look more classy. the belt looks very cheap in person and a little hoochie mamma if you wear it with the dress i
0,I liked the product shots of this cardigan  but when i opened it up out of the package i was kind of ...unimpressed... the green wasn't quite the color i was expecting  the fabric was rougher  the lace was scratchy  the fit was boxy  and the sleeves are very dolman... none of which translated through the pictures online... i still think it's cute  but it has a much more casual look to it than i was expecting. i might reconsider if it hits sale  but for now it goes back...
-1,This was disappointing to me. i love how this looks on the model. unfortunately it made me look huge. it was all bunched up after i buttoned and put it on. i didn't find it was tts  i am a 10 m and got the m. it was too tight in the waist. before i'd even put it on  i noticed the waist looked very small. i don't even think the sizing issue caused the material bunching. it's like the buttons didn't match up or something.
1,"Beautiful sweater!! i love the color and the fit. the cowl neck isn't too tight and the sweater hangs away from the body without being boxy. it comes down to the low hip on me. very soft and cozy. i purchased the aqua in xs. fits perfectly and i'm 5"" 5' 127lbs."
0,I tried on a l and found it incredibly unflattering on a large chest  as the waist hits a bit high.  the color is vibrant...i wanted to like!
1,I ordered both colors in different sizes (xs and xxs) - petite were no longer available  so can't compare there.    color: i liked the black better for these reasons:  1) color can be worn year-round  just add a nice jacket or cardigan  and ok for winter season.  2) ivory was kind of see-through    size: xxs fit me better  the xs was wider and bigger arm holes.    sadly  the xxs was the ivory  so i didn't keep either of them.    ref: 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in wasit
0,This would be perfect except for the ridiculous attached scarf. the material is so soft and luxe. the colors are richer in person and perfectly go with everything. but the attached scarf ruins everything!! the scarf is not flattering and takes away form the cute buttons on the front. if the scarf could be removed it would be a great sweater coat. so disappointing.
-1,I ordered my usual size m and when arrived i thought the material and cut was nice.  once i tried it on it was way too big in hips.  i looked rather comical how it extended on the sides.  i returned the dress.
0,So  this dress is extremely comfortable  but it's just really awkward. i am on the fence about keeping it  my husband loves it and thinks i should. it just draws attention to the belly  so any issues after having kids  is very noticeable. not to mention the huge cutouts for the arms. very comfortable  but not sure if i will keep it.
1,Velvet always has made quality clothing and i had purchased the same shirt in another color and i wanted to see if they had other colors  they did and i got 2 more. i received in expected time and they were wrapped nicely. thank you for great choices of unique clothing.
1,"Just picked this up in my retailer store and i love it. i bought the orange print and the colors are vibrant and perfect for summer. i am 5'5"" and  140 lbs. i took a small which is my usual size at retailer. could be worn unbuttoned as a sleeveless cardi over a tank. i will wear a cami underneath as it is sheer  but that doesn't bother me. another shopper was trying this on in the fitting room and it looked great on both of us. i will wear this all summer long. looks great with denim. happy find!"
0,I got my normal size and unfortunately the moment i tried it on the details on both shoulders ripped. the dress fit fine and i basically have no boobs so i don't think it was a case of it being too small. i guess it just wasn't reinforced enough. there was also a miss-stitch in the shoulder on the back which causes the back of the dress to bunch funnily. lastly  there's a slip on the inside which i don't think was necessary. it hugs tight to the body and makes the whole dress feel oddly clingy.
0,I had mixed feelings about this dress. the material is lovely but the skirt is really odd. it has two slips  one that fits close and a second that's a bit too puffy. so the skirt didn't sit well and i thought it made my hips look bigger. the odd length made it unflattering. it might be nicer without the puffy slip but i didn't want to risk it.
-1,I love maeve but this shirt's quality was poor and it was not worth the price. i would not recommend buying this online. you really need to try the blouse on in the store to make the decision as to if its worth purchasing or not...... and in my case this is being sent back.
0,This is a very pretty shirt which is too narrow across the back. i need to be able to move my arms freely at work  so this did not work for me. you may be able to size up for a better fit if moving your arms is important to you.
1,The colors are beautiful on this shirt and it is true to size. it is very comfortable but i wish the flowing part on top was pinned under arms or something. it is attached at the top of the tank top but nowhere else so it just kind of lays over the tank with a poncho look.i also think the top layer would look better if it was longer- it hits at my natural waist and i'm petite. i still plan on keeping it and think it will be cute enough with jeans. just really wanted to love it!
1,But tight around the chest  i ordered xs petite after trying on xxs petite and both are a tad tight on the chest area  kept xs petites as bigger would be too much fabric everywhere else. green color is classic  and the back is longer than the front. overall flattering if with the right outfit. i'm 30 dd and 115 lbs for reference.
1,Cute and comfy shirt! tts- got my usual m (i'm a 10) and it has a generous fit but i think it's supposed to. it's actually a silver grey color.
0,"This top is very light and soft for summer. even the lace is soft. it's not sheer and doesn't require layering. true to size. i'm 5'4""  34dd  150 lbs- m fits well. my arms are not tiny and yet the lace weren't tight for me. but the quality of the material is average and it feels like it will last barely one summer. it's good if you are paying the sale price."
-1,"Regretfully  this dress is on its way back for an exchange. the dresss is beautiful and fits true to size  i ordered it in both colors  however  the black has a defect in the lace right on the front of the dress  and the white was tearing in a few spots under the arms and on the bottom. again  the dress is so pretty and i am hoping retailer will find me one without bunching  pulls   or tears for an exchange  but i can't pay 130"" for a dress that is already torn."
0,"This top had potential  but the cut is very boxy and not fitted at all like the front picture shows. the picture from the back is much more representative of what it looks like. i'm 5'7""  135lbs and normally wear either an xs or s and the xs in this was still huge and boxy  but very short with tight sleeves (i have small arms so hardly ever have an issue with tight sleeves). the small fit better as far as length and and sleeves  but still very boxy. the pattern and cutouts are very cute  but thi"
-1,This top is beautiful in design  but sadly  i will be returning. it is hand wash  and even after doing so  i had 2 unraveled threads resulting in large holes. unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing.
0,In my opinion  for this amount of money  the dress needs to be something really different. and this one isn't. it has several structural issues and it seems to have a split personality (summery material  dark color  flirty and fun...but overly conservative up top.)  initially  the top portion is extremely sheer. you're saved (a bit) by the extra fabric at the front  but it still seemed odd that the top isn't lined - particularly for a dress meant for winter.  there's too much going on up top. th
0,I purchased this shirt with the purple colored flowers. while the cut is fine  the quality of the fabric is not great so the shirt is very see-through. will be returning it.

1,This is my third dress-the first one was the right size  but the plaid fell on the dress in an awkward way. the second one was a size too small  but this one is perfect! i am wearing it with a belt and loving it!
1,"I saw this piece and fell in love with it. the print is beautiful and is well placed on every piece! it is a little boxy  and is a bit warm for indoors  but it is unusual enough to overlook the flaws. i am 5'10"". usually a small  but sized up to a medium with this one."
-1,I got fooled by this dress's description. it's 100% polyester and not wool as it claims to be! looks cheap.returned it!
0,I am so bummed. these jeans are the perfect weight  totally distressed (and torn) in a way that looks like you've owned them for years  they flare out at the bottom of the legs just the right amount...but there is one huge - or i should write small - problem: your thighs have to be incredibly small to get these pulled all the way on.   ----------  i am a 27 in level 99 and ag brand jeans  and a 28 in my other pairs of coh jeans and in mih jeans as well. i do not have an hourglass figure (my shou
-1,"I wanted to love this top  but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the ""grey"" that you order is much  much lighter grey. in addition  this shirt is super boxy... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in. going back disappointed."
1,This is my first maxi skirt and i am pleasantly surprised! i might not have purchased this had i not tried it on in store  but did for the fun of it and loved the shape and swing of the skirt. the material is a comfortable and substantial stretchy jersey fabric with an inner lining that keeps it from being sheer. though it is kind of a dark navy  i would agree with one of the previous reviewers that it could pass for a black and white pattern. for my sister's graduation  i paired it with a white
0,"I ordered these tees in the navy and pink thinking that it would be a slam dunk given i already bought 3 of the same tees last year. not so. this year's version is much bigger - almost 2 inches wider and about 2 inches longer. there was even a 2 inch difference between the pink and navy version so i have to assume that sizing may vary among different colors. too bad for me - but i did read a review that thought the tees were better this year. i guess we are all different. at 5'7""  115lbs i prefe"
1,Lovely dress that i recommend  just not for those with my body type.  i'm broader and rounder on top so i assumed the vertical stripes would slim me down.  from the front everything is awesome--from behind it was less flattering.  made my flat bum look flatter.  also the stripe patterns do not match at the break.  other than that the quality is fantastic  the fabric is a great transitional weight  the fit is comfortable  and the style is classic.
1,"I was hesitant to buy this dress with all the reviews regarding poor fit  particularly in the bust area  but it's so unique that i decided to give it a try anyway by ordering a petite size. i was pleasantly surprised to find that it fits beautifully in my usual size. i did not find the bust to be small at all  and the overall fit was very slimming and flattering. for reference  i am 5'2"" 110lbs 32dd  and the size 2p looks great and is very comfortable.  the 0p might have worked too. the material"
0,Bought this on a whim. i had been wanting a new maxi dress and the bodice looked really cool online. ordered it in black. it fits true to size however the material is a bit on the thin side and where the fabric crosses over on the lower waist line...it leaves a love handle lump. without the bulk it would be great as overall look is kind of cool. however  i am on the fence on this one. for the money there are better maxis out there.
-1,As much as i wanted to love this top  it was too flowy and and i felt like i looked bigger than i am (i'm a size 6). maybe a smaller size would have made a big difference.
1,I loved the print on both  but first bought the blue to check out the fit and feel. i went ahead and ordered the cat one today. the fit is relaxed and slightly oversized so if you want a slimmer or less boxy fit  size down. for myself  m was perfect since i'm built larger and broader on top. the top is a bit long  covers my hips and some of my bottom. it's a mixed fabric design  so the linen part may feel scratchy to sensitive types.
0,"This skirt material and quality is top notch. i'm not a ""mustard yellow"" fan but the color combo in this is just stunning! i'm 5'4""  125#  27/4 usually and picked a 4 in this which would have been correct. the top bad is very thick so it was just too much at my waist. in the modeling pick she is covering about half the band with her tied tank top. this would look beautiful on anyone approx 5'6"" or over i think! oh  and the drape is beautiful  not super full."
0,"I am about 5'6""  135 lbs and usually wear between a small or a medium. i ordered a small  as another reviewer did. right when i took it out of the packaging  i could see that it was going to be much shorter than you can tell from the online photo. i knew the sweater was going to be cropped  but it falls right at the top of my hip bones. when i raise my arms up  my whole midriff shows. did not flatter my athletic build at all. the fit around the shoulders and chest is fine  skimming but not tight"
-1,I saw this online and went to the store to try it on. so glad i did! it did not work on me at all! it is so wide - just did not look right. it was also not flattering at the neckline either. i thought it was beautiful until i had it on! too bad - wanted to love it!
-1,I loved the shirt until i washed it! awful fabric quality. cheaply made.
