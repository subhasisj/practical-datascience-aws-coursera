1,Love this top-i love the colors  flow and that you can wear with a regular bra and straps are covered. i was torn between the xs and s but went with the s due to length. have already worn several times with a casual white jean summer skirt and crops. love love love.
-1,Loved these in store when i tried them on but was in between sizes so i ordered them in the larger size. boy do i regret that! these stretch out so much i have to wear a belt with them and it gives me this saggy bunchy front when i sit...not attractive. wish i could return them  but i took the tag off and wore them not knowing this before hand!! if in between sizes definitely size down.
1,"I walked right by this dress until an associate of mine asked me to try it on. i am so glad she did. this dress is far more flattering on me then i expected and it has pockets! after assessing it further  i decided i liked the material it is lined and will not make you look like a wrinkled up paper bag after sitting down. i bought a small  i compared the medium and both would work on my frame because of the tie waist. i am 5ft 3"" 137 lbs 36b chest and i have a proportionate athletic figure. for"
1,"This is a really nice fitting sweater knit skirt. the knit is soft and comfortable  heavy enough to smooth out some bumps but definitely shows your curves. i got medium and it's a little snug at the waist (i'm about 29-1/2"") but not so much to return it  and it fits the rest of me great. the only thing i wish was that they'd made the slip full length  it only goes about mid-thigh and sometimes when i get up the slip stays up while the skirt falls right  but not a big negative."
0,"I bought these in the blue. i sized down  as other reviewers mentioned  going for an xs. i'm 5'5"" and about 130lbs and would usually buy a small. at 5'5"" the length was too long for me  hitting me below my ankles  rather than how shown on the model. strike 1. then  i felt the material was pretty thin - strike 2. and lastly  they hung a little funny on me  rather than being a bit loose like jogging pants should be - strike 3. despite the great sale price  these went back!"
1,I just ordered this item and wore it yesterday. received compliments from my friends. truly a great sweater. feels soft to the touch. i love the cut and how it falls around my hips. sleeves were nice and long. i am a tall lady with long arms. almost 6 ft  weighing about 155. i got the med which was a perfect fit for me. love the off white. almost thinking of getting the peachy pink too.
1,This dress i received is stylish  comfortable and very nice to wear. i love the length  goes just below the knee and i am 5'2 so it is perfect for me. i can't say enough about this dress as i can't wear a lot of things because i am apple shaped but with this dress no one would ever know. thank you retailer for this beauty!
-1,This is a cute top but i wore it for around 5 hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin. i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower!! i guess it's going to have to wear off. thank goodness it was not a hot day!! i hope that i can return it.
1,"I loved this top  and i normally order petites when i'm able to  but this wasn't offered in a petite size so i took a chance and ordered it in regular. just got it in the mail and when i pulled it out i thought wow  it is a petite! but its not  just runs small. i got the xs size and it was tight under the arms  and the peplum bottom came up a bit high and felt slightly maternity-ish the way the bottom part flared out. i actually thought it was a bit too short too  even on me (5'2""  about 118 lbs"
-1,This dress had beautiful details  and the material was better than i expected; however  it was huge! it completed swallowed me. i am 5'1 about 106 pounds with quite a bit of muscle. i ordered a 00p and it still looked like a sack.
0,Would have loved this skirt  but the xl is closer to a size 12 than a 14 or 16. larger ladies beware!
0,I absolutely love the look of this shirt with the built in layering piece. the overall garment is lightweight and not too heavy even with the added layer. however; this runs really large. in general  this brand runs large for me and i would say that if you are used to this brand  you can stick with your normal sizing for this brand. however; compared to other brands it runs very large. i think it would work fantastic for me in a different size. it is not at all fitting so it would be more like a
1,This sweater/coat is great. it super comfortable. it's perfect for my california winters! it could be layered for colder areas. this piece definitely runs large- like really large. i went with an xs instead of my usual small or medium. it is meant to be boxy  and still is but sizing down allowed for it to be more flattering. i'd definitely say go in store and try it on  you'll love it!
0,This dress looks like it would be so much fun to wear. when i tried it on  i was swimming in it. i do have to admit that the movement of the dress (had it fit right) would have been very fun. i was also really disappointed with the lining. there is dark green piping along the neckline  which bled through the pink of the dress and make it look like you dropped something on your dress. returning it :(
0,I sized up based on other reviews which was good advice. i am typically a size 6 but sized up to a 10. the pants are very unique and i think on the right body type would look amazing. it seems like someone with curves and a small waist might fit these splendidly...but that's not me. i had some extra material puffing about in the zipper region. i also expected the material to be thicker but found it to be more silky.
-1,Sleeves were tight  was difficult to put on ?. for the price  you want to love the shirt. sending it back.
1,I look at the top quite a few times before i bought it.  i absolutely love it !  it's a super soft thick cotton material   it drapes perfectly and wears well.
-1,"I love everything by cloth & stone so was excited to see that they made a dress. hooray! i ordered it in the xl  which is my usual size in their shirts. when i tried it on i was so sad to see that it barely fit around my tummy and hips! i am a true size 12/14 and the xl just barely gave me enough room to move. my chest also caused the dreaded ""button gape."" it is clear that they cut the dress for people with a stick straight figure. so disappointing!!"
1,The material is soft. it looks perfect with ankle jeans or flare jeans.
-1,The first time i wore it  felt wonderful. had it cleaned and then the back end stated pilling. very disappointed with the price and quality. wish i could return for my money back. sad
1,I didn't look close enough when i ordered and failed to see that this was a peplum top.  it did not do my post-pregnancy body any favors.  but the collar area detail is quite nice and this would look great on the right body.
-1,Looks great on the photo and from previous reviews i decided to give it a try. the material seems cheap and stiff. would not fit my frame well.
1,"I bought this in the pattern in a size medium. i am a size 4-6 (38"" around the hips/butt). the small fit but felt very clingy to my curves. the medium gave me a little more wiggle room and didn't outline every curve of my butt. the material is very soft and comfortable  but it didn't feel thin or cheap or see-through. it has a nice weight to it. i am tall (almost 5' 9"") and it fit me just as it appears in the picture."
-1,I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps  which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern. however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness. the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps  so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top. i wanted to keep this but h
-1,"I'm 5'5"" and 140 lbs - hardly super-tiny and the xs was swimming on me. the shoulders are oddly large and this beautiful sweater/jacket just hangs off the body. believe it when they say ""oversized styling"" - unfortunately will have to return."
-1,The title says it all. looks very pretty online though.
0,Very nice material  soft and feminine colors. however  the waist sat higher than my natural waist and was uncomfortable. unfortunately it's going back
-1,These socks were very thin and the elastic at the top was very rigid. i could not get these socks to go any higher than half-way up my calf. i would not recommend this product. it felt very cheap and not of good quality.
0,The breast and arm area is too tight. best to size up two sizes. the blouse runs too small overall. the color is a darker blue than pictures in the photo. it's a pretty blouse  and great quality.
1,Cute shirt  it looked big so i ordered a size smaller. worked fine. would have liked the option to go even smaller so i would suggest ordering down. ultimately too baggy on my frame so sending back. fun shirt though!
0,Everybody else is correct. the dress is adorable but the fit is weird. i am usually a size 2 (134lb  34 c) but got the 4 based on the reviews. the waist fits perfect  the top is huge  especially the armholes. if i get a size 2 then the waist will be too tight. however  the dress is so cute i am considering taking it for alterations and keeping it. definitely it has fit issues.
-1,Fits large  wrinkles easily and not what i expected for the price.
1,This dress will be perfect for the mid-september wedding i'm attending. september is a transitional month fashion-wise and this knit dress will be perfect. the shimmer (which isn't apparent from the website) makes it festive enough for a wedding.
1,"I really love these leggings. the different textures that all the colors have make them interesting. quality is great. i am 5 1"" and 125lbs. the s/m fit pretty well but i wish there was a xs option. but still would not hesitate to buy again!! i actually went to retailer tonight to purchase all the other colors ...that's how happy i am with this purchase!"
0,This shirt runs extremely large. looks boxy and unflattering.
-1,I originally bought this dress in the store. however  it ended being a size too big. so  i reordered the smaller size online (although it was backordered for a month). when it arrived  i noticed the sleeves were not cinched (like they are in the picture as well as the original dress i had purchased in-store). i thought maybe it had been a fluke so i returned the dress and reordered it again because it is a great dress. the second one just arrived and the sleeves are not cinched as well. this may
1,This dress is so much prettier in person - the pattern is unique  adorable and not over-powering. i'm an xxs petite and i can wear the dress with flats. (5ft) i think this is versatile enough to wear to work  party or a casual wedding. the fit is perfect - hugs at the correct spots. the fabric feels really soft and silky and feels a bit heavy which allows it to drape nicely. overall - i love it.
1,"Green color is fantastic - dark forest green. material  wool  is substantial and of good quality. however  on my 5'1""  120lb athletic frame  i felt both the petite xs and petite s were too small for me when worn over a v.v.v. thin ls t-shirt. i also thought it was a bit too short in the back. the petite medium would have been a great fit for me  but all gone."
-1,Great fabric and color but fits like a potato sack -- so sad bc i would have loved it
-1,These were so perfect for the first hour or so. i was convinced they were my new favorite pants! but their initial forgiveness turned into a slovenly stretch  and they creased and wrinkled like crazy after i'd been sitting a couple hours. it looked downright embarrassing - saggy and wrinkly (radiating from the crotch  no less) . i got them in the gray  and it's possible that other colors use different  less awful fabric.
0,It is polyester but seems good quality. looks like a girls nightgown with the pattern combined with the baby doll dress silhouette and the overall width of the dress. i usually wear a small but  to look like it does on the model  6-8 inches would have to go in the width.
1,Fit is boxy yet flattering and material is sheer but not overly delicate. took my usual size four  i am moderately short waisted.
-1,I purchased this in-store in a vivid red color  but didn't try it on until i got home. big mistake! literally the first time i tried to zip the dress  the cheap  horrible zipper noted in previous reviews just...broke. midway up  right under the waist tie. i was trapped in the dress for a good 15 minutes and was scared i'd have to rip or cut the fabric to get out of it; eventually i pulled the zipper apart to escape. can't wait to return this asap.
0,Love the dress and went a size up as recommended by other reviewers. but it was still too small. it's just not roomy enough in the chest--total boob squash. had to return it.
1,This is the jacket i've been looking for! i love the collar/lapels - they can lay flat or be worn up a bit. the material is really soft so the jacket is comfy and soft. the sleeves are of a ribbed material that makes the jacket even softer and more comfy. i got the black but it's really more of a charcoal black vs. jet black. the color/dye is saturated and dense so there is no sheen to the material ensures that it will be colorfast. when zipped it's form fitting but not tight (tts - i'm 120 lbs 
0,I agree with those who thought this material looked a little cheap. i ordered the white knowing about the sleeves and thought i'd like the slits  but the material + sleeves definitely gave an undesired pirate vibe.    true to size.
1,Comfortable  flattering  one step up in formality from jammies  what more could you want?
1,Wore for the 4th with white jeans super cute love the ruffle
-1,This blouse has a very cute style. the ruffles are really nice but why does it have to be so sheer? there is no way i could wear this to work without a cami. it also felt slightly on the small size - almost too tight for my normal size.
-1,"The color of the sweater is beautiful  but the fit was awful. it was too ""swingy"" and made me look like i gained 10lbs instantly  (i'm 5'1""  108lbs). i will be unfortunately returning this item."
0,The fabric is nice and could pass for silk even though it is viscose-rayon. the pattern is pretty and flattering. sadly  the fit was just off- big in the center but tight at the hips. if i size up the v-neck might be too wide. i'm disappointed that i'll have to return it. it probably would look great on a different body type. i would recommend it for apple body types but not for pear body types.
1,This is one of the cutest tops i've ever gotten from retailer. the material is very soft and flowing. it fits true to size and hange beautifully. love it. i should have gotten he turquoise one too!
0,Nicely made  pretty details  but it's cropped fairly short and is rather boxy. wore with orange linen pants and it was cute!
1,I was looking for a lightweight top to wear with black linen trousers to a party  i was not sure of this top seeing it on a slender model (i am a more typical 50 year old mom body) and i have never worn a peplum style. i put it on for my husband and approved  so i wore it. i received many compliments - a few from good friends who congratulated me for going out of my 'comfort zone' with the style!
-1,I had high hopes for this dress  but unfortunately   was disappointed and returned the dress. it flares out with too much material under the gathered waist. it's so odd.
0,"This top is very pretty  but it fits funny. it's boxy and doesn't hang well. i feel like you could almost wear it as a 2nd-trimester-pregnancy-blouse. i tried the small & the small petite. they both fit the same (too big and too boxy)  but the petite was shorter. i am 5'2""  125lbs  34b. i preferred the regular length  but if you like your tops to end at your waistband  then the petite would fit too. i still really like the top  so i may try it in a smaller size when it goes on sale."
1,If the dress fits  there is nothing not to love about it. the color  of mine  is exactly like the catalogue and first photo online (deeper and richer than the studio photos). it is not too sheer  as another reviewer reported. it has a slip  and the fabric is beautiful.    the issue i've had has been sizing and style. i wear a size 2. i ordered an xs. the dress i received was not the style of the catalogue dress or the first dress in the online photos. i was looking for the very floaty  full dres
0,"I have been looking at this top online & today i tried it on in the store in a size small and xs regular. i am 5'3""  120 lbs. 34b  and the xs fit better than small. in the small the armholes were too low & showed my bra. this is the regular cut  not even petite (& note i am on the shorter side) & the length was a few inches shorter than i would like. glad i didn't order this online in petite. i love the detail & the material looks wellmade  with the exception of the beading in one spot was alrea"
0,This dress is very beautiful - great fabric and colors - but it looked terrible on me because i have large breasts. i am 32dd and this dress made me look pregnant. if you have the right body type it would be a great breezy summer dress. i'm sad because i can't wear it:(
0,The fabric was a beautiful color  but the material and seams were not well put together. the elastic in the arm was stretched before i tried on the dress so the sleeves did not fit well. i unfortunately ended up returning.
-1,This is huge. i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape. there is no shape to this and is a lot of material. i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses  sometimes medium in sweaters.  it seamed like 2 sizes too big. the material is very soft and the collar is nice. there is a ribbon tie at the waist. the tie is wimpy and could be nicer. when tied  there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist.
1,Love the fit and color  but the material is my favorite. it's so soft and comfy. feels like your walking around in your pjs!
0,I just loved this when i saw it in store. beautiful fabric  lovely color. i ordered a small petite because petite xs was sold out. i imagine it might be a little better if it were a size smaller  but there is sooo much fabric in the pleated bottom  unless you are blessed with exceptionally long legs  it might end up looking like a witches coat. at least that is what i was told by my daughter.
0,"I'm surprised this worked for so many people. for me  this dress fit terribly. however  the fabric was very thick and the dress felt very well made. i am 5'3"" and about 117 with a really short torso  and this dress just showed every bump and lump i have. i think the bodice was just too long for me. the neckline was also too low. on someone taller  or maybe with a longer torso  i could see this dress being really lovely."
-1,I purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet. the style is very cute  but the fabric is quite thin. she will have to make that call  but if i had bought it for myself  it would be going back. i'm not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt. it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it's washed  so that remains to be seen.
0,I ordered this turtleneck in white and was very surprised to find that the material is so thin and gauzy it's sheer. i will definitely have to wear a white camisole under this every time i wear it  even when using it as a layering piece. it seems to run true to size if not a little small. the neck is interesting because it is so light and floppy...you can adjust several ways. it doesn't hold form well  though. i will most likely keep it but will never wear it without something both under and ove
0,I can usually be counted on to love a pretty top with lace detail and a bit of flow. this one has those qualities but it does not look great on me. perhaps it is too flowy because i am 5?3. or possibly the fabric is too soft a look on me. i did size down as reviewers suggested. maybe one size was not enough :-). i must return it.
0,Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it)
-1,I purchased this shirt in blue hoping it would be a basic add-on to my wardrobe. it's been about a month and i have since washed and worn it twice. the color is now fading and i found a hole in the front of the shirt! i'm not sure if its the fine fabric that caused it to tear  but i washed it on gentle cycle and didn't do anything that would have warranted a tear. sadly this did not serve up to its purpose. i wouldn't suggest paying the price tag or even sale price for an item that i don't expec
0,"I love the color and style of this sweater and was very eager to wear it  which i've now done on two occasions. but now i'm concerned about the quality and also wondering if there is a long version of this sweater and a shorter version i am 5'6"" and thin  but the sweater doesn't hit me mid thigh - only goes to upper thigh and i measured 25"" in length on my sweater rather than 30"" which seems to indicate a shorter length than on the model i wish it were longer. more a problem is that the fuzzy pa"
-1,The design is very strange. the inner slip is quite form-fitting  but the dress on top was just massive  like a sack. on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with. they looked weird just hanging off the side  so i tried to knot them like a belt. overall  this dress was not attractive on. it looks much better on the model. the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life  harsher red  blue  and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured.
-1,"This is a very pretty sweater  a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1"" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look."
