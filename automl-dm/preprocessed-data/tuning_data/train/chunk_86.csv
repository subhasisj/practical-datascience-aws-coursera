0,Way to v necked- other than that would be a nice go to top. needs a cami.
0,Was not flattering on my body - i have a fuller figure  and this just made me look like i was pregnant.
0,This top has a lot of potential (comfortable  easy to wear) but it's cut too small in the area above the bust. i tried the top in small  medium and large (i usually wear s or m in retailer tops) and couldn't get that area to not look tight or like it was pulling. you can see it on the model  too -- that space right above the bra near the armhole. i think you'd need to order a size up to get that space to work but then the top will start to look too big on the bottom.   i tried the green in the sto
1,This dress is amazing quality with stunning details. its flowy and absolutely beautiful.  i plan on wearing it whilst im in the depths of the mongolian mountains while singing operatic arias.  i ordered a size two regular  even though i am petite for the sole purpose of dress length.  ---->in the picture  the dress comes down to an awkward length on the model  the sleeves are 3/4 and it doesnt look as good as it could if the length settled down to where their ankles are  or if the sleeves reache
1,"I purchased this jacket in a pxs  as i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. the sleeve length is perfect! the fabric is soft and lightweight  which is perfect for living in southern california. i don't feel any itchiness either. the rest of the jacket fits me perfectly and hits right at the top of my hips.       there are two cute grommets on each side at the bottom by the hem  which add nicely to the look. i like how the sleeves are ribbed  giving it a comfy sweater feel. there's also two zippered pockets  whic"
-1,Gals  if you absolutely must have this top wait for it to go on sale (don't worry  it will). between the poor fit and the polyester  i have no good things to report about it. this is very much below retailer's usual quality and style.
-1,I am normally between a size 0 and 2  so i ordered these pants in both sizes to make sure i would have a nice pair of black crops to wear to work. the 0 seemed pretty tight all around  so i returned the 0 and kept the 2 even though there was a little bit of room in the waist. of course the size 2 after a few hours of wearing had completely stretched out  was bagging in the crotch area  sliding around on my waist and creasing badly behind the knees. i doubt i will wear these pants more than the o
-1,"The fabric clung to my body i expected it to flow and be breezy  it was too flimsy  the arms were too wide and overall for $100 this dress didn't cut the mustard. i'm 5'7"" 135 the dress was long enough  just didn't flow very well."
0,I was hoping to love this tunic  but it isn't what i was hoping for. the material is cute  but the piece itself is a little too baggy and just doesn't do anything for my shape. just made me look boxy all around. it felt more like a poncho than a tailored tunic. unfortunately  it has to go back.
1,Dress is comfortable  feels great and the fit exceeds flattery. the length hits just above my knees and the small side triangle cutouts add a unique cute  fun but still classic detail that i didn't notice in the picture online. i love this dress and get so many compliments.
1,The photo doesn't do it justice. the detail on the neckline is adorable and looks fantastic with jeans. texture is light and gauze-y  but i don't find it too see-though. sizing was tough- i'm 5'10 but thin on top- usually between xs & s  and went with the xs on this (ordered both to try)  sacrificing some length for a more flattering width. great for the sale price!!!
0,Nice soft jeans  cute style  and i wish i could keep them...they just are too small on me. :/ not sure if i've gained weight (which i don't think i have because i had on a size 28 pair of pants today) but i ordered a size 29 in these jeans and they zipped but just too snug around the waist. i would honestly need a 30 or 31. looks like they are selling out quickly so i doubt i'll be able to get the size i need.   if you have a small waist i think they would be fine but they don't fit my body type
0,I had high hopes for these as coh is my favorite brand of denim  and these crops were made specifically for petites. also  i was happy to see they were described as a straight jean  not a skinny. the fit and sizing seems to be a little off. i ordered my regular size in this brand  27p  but they were too big. sized down to a 26p. they were still too large in the waist (seemed very stretchy) but fit well in the legs. i like the fact that these crops were made for petites so the length was perfect 
0,Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute  it's not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit.
1,I tried these on in the store and was unsure about sizing. once they went on sale i bought the xs and have already worn them twice.good transitional grey colored short into fall. need to be ironed or steamed after wearing for a while but comfy and smooth out easily.
-1,This was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity--and especially at this length! unfortunately  this is a mess in terms of proportions. if a size 2 can barely get it off  then there is a design flaw. sadly  the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws.
1,This top/jacket is less red than it appears in the pictures - more of a wine color (as it is labeled) but it is pretty and the gold details are nice.
0,The fabric is flimsy and not substantial. i thought it ran a little small. i usually wear a large in this style  but it was too tight.
-1,This dress overwhelmed me. i'm 5 feet tall and the print and material just took over.
1,I love this dress so much that i purchased it in both grey and wine. i find the cut very flattering and slimming  and love the pockets. it works great for northern california winters  with tights  boots  boiled wool sweatercoat over it while outdoors  and on its own indoors. i wish there was a long-sleeved version. i feel exceptionally cute and cozy while wearing it. good job  sparrow! btw  i bought the other currently offered sparrow wool dress (the mock-neck dress)  and this one is just an inc
0,The print and style we're great! unfortunately  my bust unbuttons the top. there's no way i can wear this  even if i sized up.
-1,I'm so upset that this didn't work out. i'm petite at 5'2 and ordered this skirt in petite  however  i felt like it swallowed me up. the fabric is thick and warm so this is definitely only cold weather attire. i'm the picture it looks like there is a little leg showing  but on me  i feel like a schoolmarm. sadly  this is going back.
-1,This is not even a dolman style sweater because it's loose fitting everywhere around the arm. the point of a dolman sweater is that the sleeves are fitted around the wrist/forearm  but this is not the case with this sweater. it's super loose around the wrist area - i can fit both of my wrists into a sleeve.
-1,I was in love with this suit from the pictures. unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesn't meet the bikini bottoms.
1,I am so in love with this top. can be worn on or off the shoulders. the color is amazing!
-1,If you have any cleavage this dress will look awful. the ties drop pretty low & look trashy over cleavage. recommend otherwise - good fabric cool look
-1,This was so boxy and unflattering. i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag. was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit. sizing down would not help this one. went back!
0,This dress is very pretty colorwise  but the fit did not work for me. i could see this working on girls with narrow hips  but it didn't flatter my narrow waist/wide hip frame.
-1,I was so bummed when this came in...the colors and print are beautiful  but the neck is super itchy because of an elastic/ruffle combo. there is also a liner which is a nice touch  but it's significantly shorter than the top layer which drove me nuts. definitely going back.
0,It's a beautiful sweater but it is very wide (much wider than it looks on the model)  even in the xs/s. it is also fairly itchy. just way too big for my small frame  which is not really the look i was going for.
-1,The fabric felt cheap and i didn't find it to be a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.
1,Love this as a lightweight coat for cool to cold days. i love the squishy soft feel of the material. it works well with sweaters. love the deep pockets which works with my iphone plus and wallet. i love how simple and practical this coat is. the hood when not used as a hood makes a nice collar for the neck and head.
-1,Cute in the on line photo but in person it looks cheap and has gold running through it. if you look really close in the photo you can see it.
-1,So much right but then....too short.
1,Fits perfect. i'm 5'3 and the size 2 regular fit perfect. not too long it too short  just perfect.
1,I'm so impressed with the beautiful color combinations and embroidery but disappointed in the rayon fabric used  especially at this price point.  the sleeveless sheer blue outer dress is a flowy swing silhouette that retains many wrinkles.  i have thick shoulders and upper arms  so the armholes cut into my armpits.  the silky rayon liner is a blush rose color with adjustable spaghetti straps.  the slip has no stretch and feels a bit tight on my chest.  i ordered size medium petite and my stats a
-1,What a pity! this blouse has a beautiful design  however it doesn't fit well on the body. it's not really a size problem  it's just not a well fitted blouse. the color is very deceptive  it looks white on the picture  but it's actually pink. i'm probably going to return it.
1,I tried this on in the sotre (in balck) as i was planning on ordering the orangey one.  my usual is 0 or 2  sometimes petites. i thought the regular 0 was sjut fine and flattering. fabric is soft  adn every pattern they ahd in store was really nice (no orange-red though). was not overly snug anywhere  and i am a bit braod for my size.  i deceided not to purchase only because i have done seriosu damage in the last month *multiple purcahses) and this was one of 2 i had to pick... if it goes on sal
-1,Oh elevenses  i love your pants..the fabrics  the details  the length. i've found elevenses to be classic work pants. reliable  professional  well made. these are none of those things. the cardinal trousers are thin and the rise feels much higher that's it appears in the picture. the red pair are thin  stretchy and cheap. both pairs have to go back. i'm truly sad.
1,So simple to throw on with jeans  or you could dress it up. the ruffles give it a little extra flair. nice and soft  really comfy. i haven't decided which size i am going to hold onto. i ordered in a small and a medium. small fits me great  and i am usually a pretty standard medium. i think it just depends on what look you are going for.  wish they had it in a lighter color  like an ivory or pink.  i think the ruffle detail would look nice with a lighter shade.
0,This silk skirt was not the best look for me  but may work for others. i purchased the med  which fit fine. i just wasn't in love with the print/colors. the skirt has quality material and is well made. it's very light and airy. i did return it.
0,I wanted to love this dress. i pre-ordered it and waiting 2 weeks for it arrive. when it arrived the dress was much more pleated than i thought. i'm not sure if i misunderstood the images  but i did not know the dress was going to being pleated all over  i just thought that the fabric had a texture. the print is adorable but the shape of the dress was not flattering on me. i am pretty straight down with somewhat wide hips  but the fabric of the dress made me look larger than i am. i think this w
0,I was in love with the green print  so i ordered this despite the reviews. i wish i'd listened. the fit is incredibly weird--huge at the top but tapering in at the hips. so sad this didn't work.
1,Beautiful shirt. the color is more navy than pictured. the middle of the moon is stitched embroiderer - very original and a fun texture. my only qualms with this shirt is the trapezoid cut - it flairs out slightly but enough to notice from shoulders to the bottom hem.
0,I really lived the detail   fabric  and quality of this tank. however  the sizing seemed disproportionate. it was tight through the bust and loose the waist. i really loved all the colors i purchased online but had to return them because of the sizing.
-1,"This wasn't for me. i have a short neck and am 5.3"". the length was fine on the one i tried on  but other proportions were off. it was too big around  in the middle  yet tighter at the bottom. on me  this made it resemble a large bag. the neckline stood up on mine. even when i pushed it down to resemble the picture here with the model  it still felt like a whiplash collar (coming up over my chin). i gave it four stars for quality since the material is so soft."
1,I absolutely love these shorts! they are the perfect length  too. i have been looking for shorts this length and rise height for years. it's hard to find shorts that aren't super short yet aren't bermuda and are still flattering. i especially recommend these for those that miss wearing shorts because of insecurities with their thighs/mid-section.    rolls are not sewn on both ends  so you'll have to re-roll each wash.    wish you carried these basics at all times.
-1,I have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer  which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer. however  the quality is very poor - it feels like it might fall apart after one clean. also  the buttons where not sewn on properly. i wear an xs and the size was a good fit  but the overall quality was not worth the price (or even close to it).
0,This is a pretty dress. i bought a size 0 and the body of the dress fit  however  the sleeves were too long. had to return  as the loose and longer sleeves made the dress look too big on me.
-1,I never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss. first off  it's about 3 sizes too big. second off  it's knitted with a metallic thread that you can't really notice in the picture. i'm usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient.
-1,"This dress has a beautiful fabric  i really hated to send it back. it was just so unflattering  absolutely no shape to it. i bought a 0p  i'm 5'5"" and 117lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me."
1,"I agree with the other review that the dress runs big and long  but i love it! it's very flattering and i have super high wedges that work great with it. i don't think it runs ""super big"" but it's slightly big. definitely size down if small busted. i wore it out and got a ton of compliments. it's classy  different and hot!"
0,I am all for a cute flowy tee but this one felt like i was swimming a bit. if you're a true xs  i'd skip this one. however  if you are able to size down i think it would look really great!
1,I purchased this top on 2 colors...a great go to....stylish  soft and very comfortable.
0,"I so wanted to love this suit! it is so unique and cute  however it does not wear well on a short girl! i am 5""4 and the torso was much too short for me so the cut down the middle looked really wide and odd and the suit just made me look stumpy instead of sexy. also  for how expensive this suit it i also thought the material was pretty thin for how expensive this suit is. i'm sad to say it is going back."
1,"Contrary to what previous reviewers have said  i think this top fits really well  and is very flattering. i also don't find it too long at all. i normally wear a size small  and got this in a size 4. no gapping at the chest  and i'm a 34d. (5'4""  124 lbs  36-27-35). and the colors in the striped version are really pretty. i plan to wear it now and right through spring. i did have a quality issue  however. the first one i received had bunched up stitching where the pleats begin right below the po"
0,I really thought from the picture that the dress would be more fit for a curvy figure. it is  unfortunately  more well suited to those women with straighter lines. the color was more flat than the picture as well  but i bet it is lovely in navy.
0,These are a wonderful trouser style pant. i love fitted than flared denim so this fit isn't my top pick but it's a cute style! thick quality denim fabric with a medium rise cut.
0,This top would be great if it were longer and the neck wasn't so open. even for a boatneck  the neck was too wide. for those that don't mind showing their stomachs this top will be okay. the material is nice and stretchy and i like the stripes but just way too short for me.
1,This looks beautiful and fits true-to-size. the material has enough weight so that it hangs well. this is a very form-fitting dress - i wouldn't recommend it to someone uncomfortable with a close fitting style.
-1,I loved the look of this dress online  so i was excited to order it  but when it arrived i found it was not at all how i expected it to be. i thought the material would be more lacy  but it seemed pretty cheap. there was also some boning at the waist which is nice in theory  but it made the material poof out just under the waist  making me look like i had a belly. no matter what i did i could not get it to lay flat. returned to the store and bought the embroidered perennial dress instead  which
-1,So unflattering! really disappointed. made me look 6 month pregnant and i'm a petite size 2.
-1,"I was so excited to purchase this dress; i love all shades of grey for winter clothing  i love knits  and i have loved other maeve dresses. however  i simply cannot fathom how poorly this is designed--it fits absolutely nothing like it appears to on the model  to the point that i wonder if i might have received a defective dress.  for reference  i am 5'5""  slender and small-boned but also curvy (hourglass). my bust is 36 c  hips about 37-38. i normally wear a small in maeve dresses. maybe it's j"
-1,I bought this top and it ran huge  i had to get an extra small. well then i wash it according to the instructions and it shrunk horribly! like its so small now my 3 yr old could probably wear it! i'm so sad  i really liked this top....but for it to shrink after one wear is not acceptable.
0,"I ordered this dress in small  my usual size (for reference: 5'7""  125 lb). it is too wide. it looks more fitted in the pictures and hangs loose on me. the belt does not help much; it still looks like a sack and i feel like a girl wearing her mom's dress.    also  i found that the material crumples easily."
1,This is my third pair of these pants. they are my everyday staple  good for work or play
1,This is a basic henley  and it is made well; a wardrobe staple  for sure. the cut is flattering  and the material is soft. i ordered the small  which is tight fitting. i'm a 34 c for reference.
1,Great alternative to yoga pants  these pants are stylish and on-trend but also easy going. dress them up or throw on a hoodie and your look is instantly transformed with very little effort!
1,This dress is beautiful. it was on back order and i waited about three weeks to receive it. i usually wear a size 8 in retailer but because it was a button down dress  i ordered a size 10. the bottom is a great fit but the top is difficult to button. it is a heavier weight so i feel it is better for the spring than the summer season.
1,While i have to agree with some other reviewers that this is not the most flattering coat (as a size 12/14 with hips  it does my hips no favors)  but the comfort and warmth make up for it. this coat is so soft  it's like wearing a puffy blanket. unlike typical puffer coats  it does not have any kind of vinyl feel to it- but nor does it have any wind or water resistance at all. with all that said  the comfort and cosy feel won me over. i've received several compliments as well  so maybe it's more
0,This dress did not work for me. it was shapeless and boxy. i tried to belt it but the white front looked odd. if you are tall and thin maybe but not for the short girls.
