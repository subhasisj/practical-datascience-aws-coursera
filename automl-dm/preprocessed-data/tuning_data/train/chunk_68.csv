1,This is the first maxi i purchased this summer. i went with a petite as the regular length would need to be altered and i didn't want to lose some of the pattern on the bottom. it is a beautiful flowy dress. no need for a slip. it has beads on the bodice. i kept the dress but it is tight at the chest area and sizing up wouldn't have made that much of a difference..kinda uncomfortable in the chest area. has yet to be worn so may return..
-1,I really wanted to like this dress  but where the skirt meets the top of the dress in the back creates sort of a hunchback effect in the back. will be returning.
1,Dress is darling and well made. however  it runs very large. i tried to size down but then it became a little short in xsp. would be great for taller slim women. the style is so cute. the online picture does not do it justice.
1,I just got this top and can't wait to wear it for spring/summer! it is a lovely lightweight material and hangs loosely and comfortably. it definitely runs quite large so i would at the very least consider ordering on the small side of what you normally wear if not sizing down one completely. this is coming from someone who usually likes tops on the roomier side  so trust me on this! overall  i highly recommend this top if you're looking for a muted but unique  comfy top for the warmer months ahe
0,Let me start this review by saying  75% of my clothing is from retailer and i love them. my husband bought this sweater for me recently and it's gorgeous  but when i tried it on one sleeve was longer than the other. i went to the store and tried on several sweaters even in different colors and had the same issue. sometimes is was extreme  sometimes is wasn't as noticeable. it was noticeable to me  however  as i am 6' and sleeve length is super obvious when its too short. love the sweater  as it wa
1,Beautiful color  great quality! on sale too. a must have!
1,"I'm surprised i'm the first to review this dress! it is a must for the holidays and any special occasion! it is absolutely gorgeous! it is so feminine and seductive; it's one of those dresses that would be stunning on anyone! it is a quality dress  beautifully made  looks just like the photo. i'm 5'9"" & the hemline falls at the top of my knees. the neckline is exquisite & really ""makes"" the dress. i purchased the black version but if i was younger i'd get it in red as it would garner quite a bit"
-1,"Since this sold out so fast i ordered an xsp which is too short (i'm 5'5"")  it also is too big! the empire waist has no shape or flatter  the sleeves are huge  the neckline was falling off my shoulder  i put it on and instantly knew this was all wrong.   the print is very fun and my guess is that's what is attracting everyone to it.  it looked like a big floppy mess of cute fabric on me.  back it goes."
1,Super cute poncho to add to my wardrobe.  love the grey color and the material is super soft.  glad i snagged this up for less than $30!
-1,This top is absolutely gorgeous  but i followed the care tag to a t and it completely fell apart in the wash. will be returning.
0,This is completely see-through and i think it would look awkward with a cami underneath because of the highly structured shape. fairly cute fit  but not as a layering piece.
0,Absolutely stinning dress! statement piece for sure however i will agree with other reviews that the bust is small and has no give or wiggle room with the side zipper...one if those dreaded side zippers that you always fear breaking as you dress. sizing up would help but the waist then appears too big or bulky.. i am on the fence about whether or not it's a keeper ...definitely perfect for the smaller chested. i usually wear xs size 2/4 the 6 zipped the 4 nearly did but would've smashed. neverth
1,I tried this dress on in-store and fell in love with it as soon as i put it on. it's beautifully made  the fabric is soft  comfortable  and free-moving  and overall it has a lovely vintage  romantic look. i actually ended up wearing it for a family photo shoot the next week  and was pleased with how it looked in our photos as well  especially the lovely way the fabric draped. another reviewer said it seemed baggy and oddly-shaped; it does seem shapeless before you tie the waist tie  but once tha
0,These pants are so cute and comfortable that i ordered each color.  after wearing the black ones one day  they stretched out so badly that i returned the other two colors.  i wish the fabric was thicker with more stretch because the style and cut is really cute. bummer
0,"While i had high hopes for this dress to be my ""go to""  unfortunately o couldn't get passed how cheap the material felt. the cut and pattern both worked on my petite frame  however  the cut out pieces in front are not lines and exposed the top portion of my bra."
-1,I had been looking at this dress on-line hoping for a pop-back and when i went into my local store today there were two on the rack and one was my size. i found the colors and print a bit blah (i felt like it could use a little detail for the price...bead detail or embroidery) in real life and i didn't love the fabric  in my opinion it is a bit too stiff and doesn't drape particularly well. things got worse in the dressing room...it was a disaster on me. i'm busty and while the top fit  because
1,These jeans were not for me. they are very straight...hence the name 'parallel'. i'm have more of a straight athletic build so for me it was too much straight and didn't flatter my shape at all.    however  very nice jean once again from pilcro.
-1,I have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans. my favorites are the cords i got last year  similar to these  so when i saw this fun pair  i had to have them. i ordered both the 32 and the 33 to try on.    they are even more beautiful in person than online. and they are so  so small. it wasn't like they were a tad snug--i couldn't even get the button across to meet the buttonhole. on the 33.    i've never had a problem fitting into retailer pants before. this was an extra-depressing first time
1,This sweater poncho is a nice versatile piece to wear in the fall. wear a blouse or tee under for extra warmth for the maine winters. love the side buttons and the uniqueness of this poncho. true to size  great color. lot's of compliments.
-1,This shirt appears nice in the pictures. it appears to have a bit of style. wrong. the shirt is one of the thinnest fabrics i've ever purchased. i live in warmer climate and its nice to have different cotton shirts with some style. this shirt has no style  and i thought it would. i have purchased this brand before  and thought this fabric would be similar. the other shirts were way nicer  softer  and had a different level of construction. i wanted to wear this shirt out and when i put it on it w
1,I love these pants! they are comfortable and dressy enough for work! the wide leg is the perfect size and the higher waist is professional! these are also nice and long for wearing heels. i ordered a size 27 and they fit great. i normally wear a size 6 in us sizing.
-1,I really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isn't for me. the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable. the fit is not quite right on me. the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt. i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not. it was not very comfortable for me either  so this was clearly not a win for me.
1,This sweater has a retro feel to it. i like how it hits right at the hips and it's not too long or not too short. it keeps you warm and it's a nice alternative to all the drab sweaters that you would usually wear in the fall or winter.
-1,"Ordered online  and when it came i was very excited to open it - but the photo doesn't show how incredibly wide the cut is. it is also quite cropped and looked very awkward on me - 5'9  130. the embroidery is lovely  but the style doesn't work. i had a small  but the area in the shoulders was cut very tight and it would not have worked well if i wanted to raise or lower my arms above shoulder height. might work better on someone with a more petite frame  but i do caution how ""voluminous"" the cut"
-1,I've been wearing this very comfortable and cute coat for 2 weeks. it is already tearing at the seams somehow. the quality of this is very poor.
-1,I am 5 6' and 130 pounds and ordered this in an xs. the sweater is enormous. the material is also scratchy and not soft at all. i'm disappointed with retailer's sizing this year. i've had to return a # of xs items because they are huge. really disappointing.
0,This t-shirt is uniquely designed and it fit well. unfortunately within an hour it shed all over. i had white fuz all over my arms and pants. i was very disappointed.
-1,Cut out design  no seems or hems.   very disappointed in retailer
0,I don't love this skirt as much as the other reviewers do. it fits a little bit weird on me  and i wanted the tie to be adjustable so i could bring in the extra fabric a bit (the knot is not adjustable). the skirt is borderline tight around my rear and legs  so i can't size down. the knit is substantial  so that's something -- but i found the extra fabric around my middle just wasn't flattering on me. i had recently bought and loved lilke's tideline pencil skirt  which also has a fabric tie wrap
1,I am a shopper....i shop a lot. this is one of my favorite dresses of all time! so unique  and  as others have said  like a piece of art! the fit is tight through the middle but that's what makes it look so perfect. i wore with tall brown suede boots and got compliments from ken and women alike. i love it!
0,Saw online and had to have. got it home and i was swimming in it! i normally am a size l in most retailer brands  but this felt so large! the actual top is lovely  with an airy artistic quality to it. not sure if i will go back for the medium or not.
-1,Guess i should've looked at the pictures more closely. i ordered the white version and in the pictures you can't see that the sleeves are split - and it barely shows in the picture for the blue version. it also would've helped if the detail of the sleeves were noted in the item description. anyway  i will be returning this top because i don't like the way the sleeves look each time i bend my arms. looks a bit pirate-like to me.
1,I love love this top and bought it in both colors. it runs a tad big but fits me well. both l and xl fit me well  but the xl was longer so i have one in each size. i really like this top. it looks good  goes well with most pants especially blue  and is very comfortable. i am very happy with my purchase.
1,"I've been desperate for a swim cover that covers my arms & back. this one fits nicely--just a pretty  feminine  happy summer top that still lets me be leggy. i can't see them in the photos  but the embroidery detail at the upper part of this top has little mirrors sewn among the dots. very fun! i'm 5'5"" and when i paired this with jean shorts  everything below the crotch was visible--so perhaps slightly shorter than it appears in the pics."
0,In the photo  this sweater is very appealing but in person very disappointing. i am 5'7  always take a size medium but on me  the sleeves were far too long and the sweater just didn't fit properly. the collar doesn't fold right in the front and it hangs awkwardly. if you try to use the button  it stretches and looks terrible. in the back  it falls short. it's going back.
-1,I am not particularly large but i have thighs! this pair of pants was totally unflattering! my butt looked fine but everything else looked bigger and my legs looked like stumps. i now understand why it's on sale. you may like these pants if you are tall and thin legged. but otherwise skip them. plus the material seems like it would discolor or stain easily. i had a pair from retailer in the same material last year that developed an odd discoloration the first time i wore them.
1,I have no idea why this has bad reviews! how is there any left?! this is a beautiful piece that i had to have in both the navy and green. i love that it comes with a cami. it&#39;s very flattering and not too wide or boxy. the lace detail is amazing! i bought my usual size and it fits perfect. love this top!!
1,Okay  this is the cutest sleep jumper i've ever owned. it's soft and cozy  and even a tiny bit sexy. i give it 4 stars because it's a little on the thin side; not sheer but close. really fun little piece. definitely recommend.
-1,I really wanted this dress to be perfect  but the skirt portion flares out in a way that was not flattering. the other reviewer is about 8 inches taller than me  perhaps it works better on a taller frame.
-1,Cute sweater. snap was broken when i received it. and i looked for it at local stores and they are all out of stock. ugh!
0,Well - i was disappointed in the fabric for this dress. it is a heavier material and i suspect will not be very cool / comfortable during warmer weather when i would normally wear a sleeveless dress.  on the upside - the pattern is really pretty.
1,I just bought this in the yellow and am very pleased!!! the sleeves are super long but i'm happy about that! usually  they are much too short  this is much cozier! this will look cute over dresses and with jeans and a longer/tunic style top. nice quality too
-1,I'm 5' 7 and bough a size 8 regular. this is so short that if you wear with jeans you can see a midriff. cute pattern  but i'm returning it.
0,I tried this on in my usual size and it was tight through the chest because of the lining. i would have preferred to wear a cami beneath and then it may have worked. the color and pattern are gorgeous  the fabric feels a bit weird  kind of dry and rough? would have liked to see this in a longer length  and more tapered. it is an absolute pregnant top. so sad its so pretty!
1,I saw this and had to have it!  it is so beautiful.  it has pops of color that can be paired with so many options.  i like the uniqueness of the flowers being on the backside.  it is thinner fabric  so i will have to wear a black cami underneath but i have no problem with that.  especially  going into cooler weather anyway.  it is very flattering on.  this one will go fast.  thank you retailer!
0,I really liked this dress in so many ways. i'm tall and pear-shaped so the flowy shape is great for me. however  the deal-breaker was how the armholes were cut. it isn't that obvious in the photos  but they are cut in around the bust in the front in a way that was really weird looking on me  and it was too expensive to keep something that's unflattering. too bad  if they had just had a normal armhole it would have been a home run. lovely fabric and nice that it has pockets.
1,I really love this top. it looks great under a black tahari suit that i wear to work. the neckline looks really nice. the only negatives are that it's a bit sheer  so i have to wear a tank under it and it's a little wide. it looks fine tucked in or hanging out with jeans for a more casual look. i'd recommend this top  especially if you can get it on sale. pretty true to size. i'm 5'4''  120 pounds  and a 32 c and the size 4 top fit me nicely.
1,I do love this shirt  but when it arrived  it had makeup around the collar  apparently from someone else who had tried it on. i was able to clean it up with just soap and water so no big problem  but it did make for a poor first impression!
-1,This didn't work for me. im normally a m (8/10). got this in xs. that was the correct size for me  i believe. however  the armholes were huge. husband said the top of the dress looked like the autobots symbol from transformers and he wanted me to keep it. but  i sent it back.
-1,Fabric is not as rich as shown in photo. dress much shorter than shown in photo. shoulder area is tight and really doesn't blend with the material below. this isn't going to work on very many people - pear shape...just not what i've come to expect from retailer.
0,"I bought this dress in a regular xs. i am 5'3"" and 108 pounds. i have a long torso so the regular would fit better than the petite. although the overall fit of the dress was good  the straps could have had about an inch taken out and the pockets gaped open! in the photo  the mode's arms are laying over where the pockets would be  which fall on the seam and when i tried this on  the dress fit beautifully but the pockets gape open on the sides and it looks like little wings from the front. the dre"
1,This skirt fit  but is very body con. if you are not comfortable with such a tight fit  consider sizing up. overall  the design is beautiful and the fabric is heavy (hides bumps). i plan on ordering one size up  hoping that the waist is not too big.
0,I got this shirt and loved it so much the first time i wore it. it swings well and is an easy basic that looks great. however  after i washed it the first time  it became clingy and stuck to me and doesn't lie right. it's such a shame because i was thrilled with this as an addition to my wardrobe!
1,I thought this shirt was really interesting online and it doesn't disappoint in person. i love the uniqueness of the shirt but wish the quality of the white fabric was a little higher. overall though this was a great find and i know i'll wear it again and again.
-1,"I love almost all tops from retailer  however this one was just enormous. it is beautifully designed  but it was so huge when i tried it on that i couldn't believe it was sized 0. i even checked the tag to see if maybe they placed a size 0 tag on an xl shirt. for reference  i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. i would have loved this shirt if it hadn't been so big."
0,Top is very wide and flowy. i am petite with large chest so it hung from widest point and was not flattering. would be very cute with the right body shape.
1,The color and quality of these jeans is great. they were too large in my normal size. more of a boyfriend fit so size down.
0,"Tried this lovely with high waste  wide leg  black flowy pants. everything i could hope for and more  but not quite!    size: blindly ordered size 6. i'm usually a small  occasionally xs in retailer brands like floreat and akemi+kin. i'm 5'5"" tall  130 lbs  34d  35-29-37  long torso  narrow shoulders  and short arms.    fit: size 6 had just enough space through the bust. the lace edged sleeves were roomy and just reached my wrists. the shoulders were just right. extra fabric ballooned out around t"
0,This is a cute dress but the fabric is very heavy and i didn't find it to drape well on me. it is a very heavy felted poly type of fabric. i ordered it for a specific event coming up this summer and the fabric will not work for warm temps. the style and design of the dress is great though. for reference it did fit fairly true to size. i wear a 0 or 2. the xs fit well. if the fabric works for your situation then i would try this dress.
0,I bought this top online in the stripes/ivory lace. fits great and is beautiful quality. (i usually wear small/size 4 in tops and the small was perfect). however  i found that the ivory lace detail on the bottom sides gave me a saddlebag effect. not good. sadly it's going back.
-1,I thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed. i am 5'7 and i usually wear a size small top and 4 dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge!! i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasn't expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack. i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad. i was so upset. it also has thin silver lines through it which  for me  m
1,"I ordered a size 4  my usual size in tops is s or xs for looser fitted tops  i prefer a more fitted look. for reference i am 5'4"" 120 lbs   32d. i ordered in pink and the color matches the online image. the pink is shear and i do have to wear a camisole underneath  which does not bother me at all. the top is adorable with jeans or slacks for work."
0,Run large and leg is very wide. even sizing down  they seemed too floppy.
0,This top looks real cute on the model! wish it looked like that on me! way too big  so not flattering on my petite frame. sadly going back!
-1,Wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased and wore two of these. washed as directed and same outcome as everyone else. basically unwearable unless i maybe use it for a nightshirt. the shrinkage lengthwise was ridiculous. glad i didn't buy every color like i had planned to do!
0,This is an attractive shirt but runs big. i ordered the black and white.
0,I lived the front and back designs but didn't like the fit.
0,"I wanted so badly to love this sweater. the colors in the blue motif are fabulous and the yarn is soft and warm. but it does not fit me in a flattering way. i can't recommend a size  because the s and the m were exactly the same size and fit. the neck is broad and bulky and overwhelming  the sleeves have bulky cuffs that come down to my fingers  and the sweater slides across my shoulders. i'm 5'6"". it appeared overstretched  and i feared it would only stretch out more over time and not be worth"
-1,This top completely fell short for me. i was so excited for it to arrive yesterday and upon opening the package i knew immediately that it was not what i was expecting. in the images online there seam up the middle of the shirt isn't even noticeable but in person it is very prominent...and not in a good way. the peplum is a lot fuller then pictured as well. did not work well with my large bust (34d). returned.
0,"The cotton  the print  and the online presentation of this dress are beautiful  i ordered right away! but there are some discrepancies. the shoulders have a ""puff"" to them that i don't notice on the model  and that doesn't flatter athletic shoulders. the buttons are (cheap) difficult to button. the waist sits much lower on the model than it must on anyone else  it's nearly empire on me. and  there is a lot more volume in the skirt of the dress than is shown in any photo. because the dress is tig"
-1,I loved this tunic the first time i wore it. i ordered it in the red and it was very flattering on my post-pregnancy figure and extremely cute with leggings and boots - just what i wanted. it fit true to size  even with a few extra pounds around the chest area. imagine my horror when i pulled it out of the wash - having followed the directions on the tag exactly - and discovered it had shrunk and no longer fit properly. in particular the sleeves became incredibly  uncomfortably tight and much sh
-1,Was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge. the material is not soft so it doesn't fall well. it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant!!
