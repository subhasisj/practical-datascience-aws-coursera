1,This top is fun to wear & looks great with black  grey or my wine color jeans!! love it!
1,Loved this skirt. it reminded me of the styles that i saw visiting paris this past summer.
1,"I am not sure where all of the other reviews on these pants went  but when i ordered mine  there were mostly all good reviews. i absolutely love these lounge pants. someone mentioned that they thought they were a little itchy where the lace is but while they may not be the softest pants ever  they are certainly very comfortable  not itchy at all. i am 5'6"""" 140 lbs and i ordered the medium. the fit was a little snug at first but  as i wore them  they stretched and loosened. i also wear them with"
-1,Unfortunately  does not look anything like in the picture. looks like an oversized house robe. i expected much more but was disappointed. i am definitely returning it.
-1,"I wanted to love this coat so bad. the material is lovely and it's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off. if you have any hips forget it (my hips are 38"")- you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy. the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders....like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted  it was weird. but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it wasn't a size thing. i bought a size medium  at 5'5"" and 140 pounds."
0,I have a mixed feeling about this cardigan.  on one hand  i like it; on the other hand  there are some minor things i do not like.  first  i love its knit pattern; especially the pattern on the back.  second  i like a soft color of this cardigan.  on website pictures  two motifs look almost the same.  in reality  brown motif is light pink-ish while blue motif is light blue-green-ish.  third  texture.  this cardigan is made of linen and cotton  so it feels comfortable to wear.  if there are flaws
0,"This top hit at my hips not as it appears on the model in the photo  and i am short at 5' 2"". cute top  but shorter than i had expected and definitely not a tunic style."
-1,"After reading the reviews  i had high hopes for this dress but was disappointed that it wasn't flattering on me.   i'm 5'4""  126 pounds and generally wear a size small  but the small of this dress looked more like a maternity outfit on me. it squeezed the bust a bit too much  and left open some of the areas just under the arms that could probably have used a teensy bit more coverage to be truly flattering."
0,What a let down. this is not what i would call a coat but a sweater. it is unlined and very lightweight. the fit was cute and would have been so great if it was actually a coat.
1,"I just received this top in the mail and i couldn't be happier with how it fits and feels on. might have to wear a camisole under with a bit see through in front. it is very true to size and drapes beautifully with the back being very feminine. i am 5'6"" and the length falls just about the same on myself as does the model. i will wear with skinny jeans with the nice length working well with them."
0,Love the shape of this top and often look to retailer for corset-style summer tops that are pretty. this top is made from a thick  stiff fabric that doesn't breathe. so my usual size xxs was too constricting. tried an xs also and it basically fit but i still wasn't a fan of the very heavy fabric in a summer top. it's almost like a neoprene. the colors are an odd choice and not my favorite either. i wanted to see in person and they just don't cut it for me. would love in different colors and softer
1,This dress is very comfortable  not itchy at all and looks great. runs on the large side and is a tiny bit unflattering in the middle but it's still a worthwhile buy!
-1,Good reason to read reviews. i concur with others in that it fins large and looks boxy. heavy fabric makes matters worse.
0,I ordered a large  and was hopeful that this would be as comfy and stylish as others reviewed. for me  it was not. it ran a little small on top  buttons bulged at my chest  and was hard to put on. bottom part fit well (although flattened my butt unflatteringly). i'm sure this works for some  just wasn't the right fit for me. sent it back.
0,I wanted to love this dress  but sadly i will be returning. the color looked fairly different in person than on the model. i thought it was a browner/neutral hue  but the dress is almost like a yellow seersucker-ish with brownish moth printing. was cuter than expected! the sweetheart neckline is darling  but that is where it fit me poorly. i have a 34c bust  and the cups of the size 4 were gaping on me in the front and all along the arm holes. the straps were also way too long and falling off my
0,I wear an 8-10 and these are a little big on me  which is surprising. they also don't lay really flat in the back. the pockets are inside in the back  in side two layers  and don't lay very flat. the crotch is low and rides up when i walk.  i'll probably wear them again  but i'm not totally thrilled by them.
-1,I gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much  right? boy was i wrong. this is a sweater knit with a very deep v-neck that's incredibly boxy and unattractive. the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on. i ordered in xl  having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium. it was swimming on me. the stripes aren't as cute in real life
1,I love this dress! i was trying on some dresses in the store and the sales girl put this one in just for fun. i would have never picked this dress out. i didn't look awesome on the hanger. but i tried it on anyway and i ended up getting two other dresses at that time. but i couldn't stop thinking about how much i loved the way i looked and felt in this dress. so i did what any girl would do and bought it online. it took me a while to find it online because the picture on line doesn't do the dres
-1,I wanted so much to love this dress  but unfortunately the fit was so poor i had to return it. the color of the dress (green) was lovely  and i liked the fabric and the overall design very much. i read the reviews and decided to order an extra small petite given that reviewers said the dress ran large; but even at that size the dress was too large  especially around the hips (which  for someone with an hourglass figure  is saying a lot!). the extra fabric around the hips belled out some  making
0,Love the colors and design  however the sweather is much boxier than what the photo shows  and it is itchy. i am still deciding as it might be fine with a shirt worn underneath it.
0,I really wanted to love this suit  but it honestly looked really matronly in person.
-1,This shirt is beautiful. it is flowy and light  a perfect piece for transitioning from winter to spring. however  do not follow the washing instructions on the tag. it says you can machine wash  tumble dry low  and despite going one step further and washing on my gentle cycle in cold water and drying it on extra low  it came out of the wash so small that a child could barely wear it. it went from being a tunic to an inappropriate crop top i will never wear again. if you do order  please take the
0,Really liked this dress  but it ran too big for me.
1,This is the most flattering shirt--love the fit and color!
-1,This is a cute item at a good price point  though the lack of lining in cartonnier items drives me batty. unfortunately  the wool is so itchy i could not tolerate it more than a second.
1,I bought this cuz i wanted a plaid shirt that didnt have too much plaid..this is true to size and adorable! i will be wearing it out and not to bed or for lounge. adorable detailing on back and on shoulders...its a keeper!
0,This dress is very cute on. very flouncy. i know it looks like a gingham dress  but it's a more like a silk dress with a gingham pattern. the one issue i had was that it ballooned out at the back where you tied it on any size (bug or small)  and i am larger on top  so i don't know what would happen with someone with a small chest. i wouldn't have minded if it did the same thing on the front  but it was just the back.
-1,"Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the ""captain kangaroo"" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don't want added bulk. very disappointing. returned."
-1,I was very excited about ordering this top as i'm tall girl (6 ft) and i like my back well covered. i liked both style and design of the top on photo but when the package arrived i was very disappointed with the material. this top is incredibly thin and see through. though fabric is nice and soft  it feels more like a pajama top. all curves & bumps immediately stand out and it doesn't look flattering. i ordered 2 colors grey and black size large and returned both  although they were true to size
0,This dress runs a bit small. the large arm holes were unflattering to my small chest. also  this dress seemed to make my belly protrude. it kind of made me look pregnant in a way that no other dress has! i could see this dress being flattering on someone with a very flat stomach or a large chest. not me!!
-1,"This ran a bit small; i'm normally a 2  this was a 4 and 'just' fit. the pattern was very 'digi ' the length was shorter than i hoped (i'm 5'1"")  and the fabric  while structured  was just cheap and acrylic-feeling. pass."
-1,This top is too boxy and has too much going on. it should have no buttons or different ones.
1,A must have 1 piece. every time i wear this i get compliments! it's very flattering  amazing quality  soft material  good support and vibrant colors! i wish this came in more colors and patterns. worth the money no questions asked!
1,"I waited so long for a small petite to come back in stock and finally it did...received the dress last week and it's beautiful it was a perfect fit for me not to big not too small (my size 5'3""/122lb). if you're petite or very thin probably size down. i gave it 4 stars because of the quality...some of the eyelets looked a little weathered. it is lined and there's no see through. agree with other reviewers though - this dress is not worth $228 price tag."
0,"As other reviewers have noted  this is a pretty top. i really love the design. alas  however  it is too big for my frame. for reference i am barely 5'1"" and about 105 lbs. i ordered my usual xxsp and the fit is just not flattering on me. it is looser than on the model and the flounce does not hit me in the proper place. the top is also too wide so that it has these odd gaps near the armpits. i highly recommend this top unless you are an xxsp. i am going to have to part with it  sadly."
-1,This dress will unfortunately be returned...so cute online and looks like a sack in person.  runs very large  arm holes are very low.  not flattering.
-1,This top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy. looked like a tent on me. this one went back the same day it came!
-1,This romper fit like a dream!  it is gorgeous  unique  and sexy. i am rating this 2 stars because it took me 20 minutes to try it on!  there is no zipper and the only way to get it on and off is by buttoning and unbuttoning the small buttons on the top. nobody's got time for that!!!!  i wanted so desperately to wear it to my friend's 40th birthday party. but i imagined myself spending half the night in the restroom trying to get this romper on and off. no thank you!  i considered buying the romp
0,This design looks really sharp on the image  but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi.  the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap.  since the fabric was pretty soft  with a gray jersey lining  it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer.      i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b  i felt like i was busting out of a size 8  and i am a 34d.
-1,When i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned. i got the black w the white collar/cuffs. i thought it was terribly itchy material (which could be remedied w a shirt underneath) but the white collar part was such a dull ugly white-dirty color. maybe the other colors are better?
1,I am 5'4 and 120 lbs and ordered a size 0. the dress fit perfectly in the shoulders and arms and below the waist  but i could barely fit my 32a size chest in the dress! the other reviewers are not kidding about the chest area being very narrow. i have had to order a size 2 instead. we'll see if that works.
1,I absolutely love these pants! i have been searching for a pair of linen pants for quite a few years but have never really found a pair that looked good on me until now. i have usually found linen pants to lack shape and end up making me look frumpy but i really love the fabric. well  these pants actually have some structure to them and are still super comfy and soft. i bought the neutral color which is acutually a very fine tan and white pinstripe which makes the pants a bit more classy. i love
0,I love vintage lace so i was very excited to try on this dress. unfortunately  it just didn't work for me. i'm a larger  busty lady (size 14) and i tried on the xl. it fit fine  but did absolutely nothing for my figure. it just kind of hung on me. even with the belt tie i still feel like it didn't accentuate my waist line. i think this is better for someone with a straighter figure.
1,I loved this top when i first saw it. i tried on my usual size l  and there is no stretch through the bust  so it totally flattened my chest. a few weeks ago i noticed there were some xl's that must have been returned. i tried them on and they fit perfectly! i suggest sizing up if you have a chest  this is a very flattering top and it looks great paired with scarves as a wrap  skinny jeans and boots.
0,Loved almost everything about this top. the colors are great  comfortable fit  but the length was a little too long for my 5'4 frame. i also wasn't a big fan of the large side slit. i would still recommend this great top.
1,These chinos fit great! they are extremely comfortable and true to size but note that they do loosen up quite a bit with wear. i bought all 3 colors!
1,I bought this top to match a maxi skirt and it was pretty close to perfect.  i got the blue color   which is more of a brighter blue than a navy.  i'm 6ft and wear a 10 top  but got this in a large hoping to gain some length in the torso out of the of a large and could have gone a size down.  the top was definitely long enough and i didn't have the problems with the gaping at the hook that other reviewers had. this is probably because i went a little larger in the sizing and i have a very small
-1,I look like i put a baggy bag over my head. also  the material really seemed like fake velvet to me.
0,The jacket was nice and soft but it was too short on my torso with a cropped fit which i'm not a fan of that style. i returned it.
-1,"My perspective is as a sewer so i'm more picky perhaps. this top is poorly made. the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece. sewers do this to save $ - squeezing the pieces on the fabric. it looks sloppy. the cut is very full; the bottom edge measures 104"" around. for my figure  curvey  at 5'6"" and 150lbs  this top is not flattering it looks maternity. perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings."
0,I think in general it is just hard to buy a bathing suit online  but i really underestimated the v-neck of this suit. i read the reviews and noted it was not recommended for girls with larger size breast. as i'm basically an a cup  i figured i would be fine. the top portion basically has no coverage or hold. even when tied very tight  the top still opened making me feel exposed and like my entire breast would fall out of the suit. needless to say my fiancã© was not a fan of the suit either. even
1,I threw this into my cart online on a whim  but i'm not disappointed! and i don't even wear rompers usually. for reference  i'm 5'2 and normally a size 2  and i bought this romper in a size xs petite. if you're on the shorter side  i definitely recommend buying it in the petite size  as i feel that this romper would run large in the regular sizes. the fabric of the top drapes nicely on me  and the shorts are about medium length. i like the neckline details. the armholes in the petite size aren't
-1,"I so loved this dress online. not so much in person. first of all it didn't fit my build. i'm 5'4"" with a 32f bust and the waist line was just a bit too high to be flattering. mainly i'm returning it because of the fabric. the petticoat netting does rustle as another buyer pointed out. my main fault is that the top fabric is synthetic and cheaply printed. basically it's the lining fabric of a better made dress or coat. if it were cotton voile or silk it would have been beautiful. why they made i"
0,Beautiful top  i love the peplum. the color is actually cream with blush accents in the lace. i gave it two stars for quality because the hem was uncut and unfinished so it's going back.
-1,This blouse is a disappointment . fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off. just odd. sleeves awkward . the back of the white shirt on the on-line model is not the same as the white shirt i received. mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white. no ruffle. returned.
1,I bought this dress thinking it would be cute for christmas in florida but when i received it i wasn't so sure about a christmas dress. i like it for a casual night out with high boots. super cute!! i received many compliments!
1,Cute top; somewhat sheer but color and fit are great. fits slim but true to size.
0,Like it; but it's quite short and rather boxy. i'll keep it because it's pretty versatile.
0,I wanted to love this top. i wanted to love it so badly i bought it twice. the design and beading are beautiful  but the sizing is off. as another person mentioned it does run short  but that was not the issue for me. i ordered my usual size in this brand and the arm holes were too tight. because i really love it  i decided to exchange it for a larger size. i did not try it on in the store because i never wear that size  and just assumed the arm holes would be larger. sadly they were not. still
0,I really wanted to love this tank top.  it has vibrant colors and a unique pattern; however  i should have listened to the reviews.  there was way too much fabric!  it made me look pregnant!  the tank top is going to be returned.
1,"Got this in the ""dark blue"" wash; there is significantly less color variation than pictured online; it's a medium wash  and incredibly soft. i typically wear m or l in this brand due to very broad shoulders and muscular biceps: if you have a similar frame and you typically wear one of two sizes  go with your larger size.  this feels incredibly silky. it's lightweight  so it can be worn (almost) year-round and will layer well over say  a tissue-style turtleneck in the winter. it's longer in the b"
-1,I bought this t-shirt in pink  blue  red  grey and black over the past year. every one of them except the grey  has gotten little pin holes in the front of the shirt below your waistline. i've returned them all. the fabric is thin and the quality of the t/shirt is terrible.
-1,This top was very cute but super short- and i am a short waisted petitie person-the waistline hits above your belly button- looks very silly.
-1,This top is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is great  the cut is nice  etc... however  the buttons are too big for the button loops  which do not have any stretch. it took ten minutes to open the shirt to try it on. once i had it on  i left it unbuttoned. i returned it. (if you can't live without it  you could put smaller buttons on it.) too pricey for a non-functioning top. too bad.
1,This an absolutely beautiful quality stylish coat but through no fault of the coat  i had to return it because i looked like a bear in it. i'm too short and too round around the middle for this type check and this type material. i wouldn't want to discourage anyone from trying it.
-1,"I love this outfit so much and bought the skirt pictured with the top on the model in high hopes my quest for the perfect date night outfit would be ended. not so. for starters the top is much more of a beige in person. a horrible unflattering color that few can get away with successfully. secondly there is just so. much. fabric. it billows and bunches all over the place to wear it out like that as shown would be silly and to tuck it in looks like i've tried to hard to make it ""work""  lastly the"
1,The lace front is more detailed than i expected  but in a good way. the sleeves are softer on the outside  but the inside is not too scratchy as others have said  in my opinion. it is comfy but i feel that the lace part is fragile and i will need to be mindful of where i'm sitting when wearing it. not a deal breaker though...
1,I loved this but didn't realize it has mohair which agitated my contacts. i had to return it. if you don't have that problem  this goes great with leggings or jeans.
1,I like dresses with sleeves as those are more appropriate for work for me. this dress is a smooth material and the asymmetrical bottom adds just a little extra something. i got it in my normal size and i do find it looser/not meant to be body hugging again making it work appropriate.
0,So despite reviewers saying this was too short i decided to try it anyways. the dress is adorable the print t g e pockets so cute but the description is incorrect. the petite falls 30 from shoulder which means it's right under your bum so you move anyway and someone gets a show. it's unfortunate because this dress is adorable. it would fit tts except length. unfortunately this one has to go back.
0,I didn't fall in love with this jacket but it was comfortable and seems like it has potential to be flattering on many body types. for reference i tried on a medium and my measurements are 38-30-40.
