-1,Dress is much different in person. thin ribbed cotton.  a little tight for xl.    it looks like a throw back dress from contempos.  returned and would not recommend
-1,It's such a pretty top but i felt that it looked maternity-ish so i returned it.
0,Bought in white. it has a ribbed detail that makes ir only for casual wear.  the white is pretty sheer. will return.
-1,Totally bummed. the pretty print doesn't outweigh the very odd fit of this dress. makes you look really top heavy and even the print  which looks so cute online  looks muddled in person. sadly  went right back.
1,I knew i needed to have this shirt as soon as i saw it and luckily for me  it was already on sale. i read the other reviews and ordered a s (usually order xs or s  but went with s for this one because i was worried about the fit of the bust). overall the shirt is huge on me. i considered returning for an xs but suspect that would also be too big and maybe too short. i decided i could get it tailored instead for the cost of exchange shipping. so i will be doing that. otherwise i love everything a
1,It's a cozy sweater that doesn't make me feel frumpy  still stylish and it's not too heavy but still warm enough. it's like wearing a blanket sort of. definitely sheer with the big loom  wear a camisole under it. i got compliments the first day i wore it!
-1,I was intrigued by the pattern of this blouse (the purple version) but the design is terrible for me. it's boxy  i didn't like the fabric  and the arm ruffles are bizarre. it's going back tomorrow.
0,These are my first paige cords/pants and they seem to run much smaller than the other brands i wear. i'm normally a 32 in all other brands but with these the waist is pretty tight. i do love the length (i'm 5'9 and they are plenty long.) i also love the bell/flare. i'm not sure what makes this brand so much more expensive as the quality though nice seems comparable to cheaper brands.
0,It really is such a cute romper. took it on s trip to italy and it was airy and comfortable. that is in till i washed it. i'm in europe so there aren't dryers... washed it in cold water  line-dried it and it shrunk. significantly. it still fits but the top doesn't blouse over like it previously did. and the shorts feel really short. so disappointed. my advice would be to hand wash it in very cold water
-1,This is the first hd in paris top i haven't loved. high hopes for this top since i love the brand and the color. this was an online only item so i guessed at the size  typically order a 4 petite. ordered the 4 regular since the length was already quite short in the regular length. it was oddly constructed  small in the arms but boxy and oddly bell shaped bottom. the lining was tough to keep straightened while trying to put it on. too bad  but it went back
0,This sweater is extremely roomy. the cut is very wide - wider than it is long  the sleeves are dolman style  and the neck is a little loose. with a lot of manipulation i managed to convince myself that i wasn't wearing a tent  but i would suggest sizing down and also being tall and thin  if you can. i'm keeping mine despite a funky fit on my hourglass frame because i'm exploring funky town lately. join me at your own risk!
1,Love the look of these- casual or dressy depending on what you pair with them. they are so comfortable! edgy but relaxed - joggers with a leather look- what more could you ask for?
1,"I finally broke down and went on a christmas shopping spree at retailer for myself with hubby in tow as they are gifts from him. the skirt is a beautiful dark navy  super soft knit. very long with a texture pattern. i am 5'9"" and have put on a few pounds lately but typical wear and 8/10 and bought the large because i didn't want to try it on. it works for me because i don't like skirts to cling to much. even my pencil skirts i like a more loose fit. normally id say a medium would probably f"
-1,So sad becuase i like the design. i would not recomend the lack to anyone that does not live and work and shop in a completely immaculate environment. i wore this to work the day after purchasing and within three hours i honestly looked like i had slept in this sweater for three monthe straight. i had to take the sweater off and work in a t-shirt.   the marigold color may be better than the black abut showing lint but something intrinsic to the fabric really attracts lint like nothing i have eve
0,Love at first sight (via the internet); upon arrival  i was on the fence. . the fabric is slinky and loose; so much so that i should have ordered a medium instead of a large (perhaps then the dress would have then been more of an a-line fit vs. an over sized dress with no body). the lower section of the sleeves is attached intricately to the upper arms; every slight movement of the body is followed by a slight tug at the sleeve/arm cloth; otherwise  when the arms are extended  the sleeves do hav
1,I ordered the green  black and ivory because i thought they were so cute. the sweater is short but still cute. the ivory one i will return though. it has sparkle that's not noticeable in the online picture plus when it arrived it had a huge snag in the fabric. i'm actually quite surprised they sent it to me in such poor condition.
1,Love these! they are my new favorite weekend pant. they are comfortable  versatile  and cute. the fit and cut are great too. a must have for your wardrobe.
-1,It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion. i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly...this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women's apparel sizing. i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small
1,I ordered the red in xs petite  xxs and xxs petite (in case petite was too short). so far  the xs petite and xxs petite were shipped to me  however  thought the bag said petite  the actual dresses inside were regular sizes  and they were huge  even the xxs (i put it on on top of another knit dress and it was big0. so i reordered  this time only the xxs petite (though i am technically waiting for the xxs regular)... perhaps all the bags have been switched... we shall see  but perhaps this isn't t
-1,I loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on: a good cut--not too drapey or fitted. but then i washed it (laid flat to dry) and it shrunk so much that it's unwearable now. so disappointing.
1,I like the dress on line: color flowers  cut  etc. but when i tried it on it was just meh... the color did wash me out a bit  the flowers are still beautiful  but the cut wasn't as flattering on my body as it was on the model. 0p fit ok  but i didn't keep it. you ahve to tie your own shoulder straps  so adjustable  i guess that is a plus.    115 lbs 30 dd  26.5 in waist
1,I ordered one size down and it's still plenty roomy. as others have said  the sleeves are a tighter fit  but there is a tiny bit of stretch to the fabric. i'm smaller busted and didn't want the v-neck to get too low  so i sized down one. very cute tucked into jeans or paired with leggings.
-1,I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable  the knitted fabric contains acrylic and started pilling a lot within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes  it looks horrible. it may be the worst case of pilling i've ever seen in a fabric. so so disappointed. it initially fit true to size but has stretched out a bit over time.
-1,This one pulled across my shoulders and neck in a creepy way. did not like the way that it fit. returned
0,I am 5'8 with curvy  muscular body and 36ddd boobs. the ruffle ends up hitting me right below my breasts and creates the look of being about 6 months pregnant. the beading is beautiful and i wish that it fit.
0,Very nice fabric but disappointed in the stitching on the knees. it looks nice but makes the pants very uncomfortable and tight around the knees. too bad because i love the style and hoped they would work!
-1,This bra runs very small  and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier.
1,From the online pics  i would never think to try this on  but i was looking for a shirtdress with pockets  so glad i did! i purchased in green and navy... i love the neck line when buttoned up  almost military jacket'ish and i like the idea of wearing over jeans and a shirt and leaving unbuttoned almost like a light layer or jacket. super soft material... i purchased a size 6 and i am 5'9 and 140 lbs.
-1,I wore this blazer for one day  didn't do anything strenuous  and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back  next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable  since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.    as to the fit  it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it  so it's good over something cute.    or  it would be  if it didn't fall apart.
-1,I was very disappointed in the quality of this top. the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front. i had to pull the thread under so it wasn't exposed. i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine. this top is extremely delicate and doesn't withstand normal everyday casual wear although it's s casual lightweight sweater. now it's just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt.
1,One of the best maxi dresses i have ever found! i needed a dress that could accommodate a large bust (36g) and camouflage my postpartum belly. the dress did it all. i ordered the large (5'7 and 155 lbs) and it is so flattering. it has just the right amount of coverage up top to prevent looking too busty. and the band around the midsection makes me look much slimmer. like i said  best maxi dress ever. price is pretty high  but it was worth it!
-1,I loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly. the arm holes are entirely too big -- so big that alternations couldn't fix it. maybe it's because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw.
0,Beautiful dress but the fit was off for me. overall this is good quality with beautiful lace detail. as the other reviewer mentioned the cutout in the back is very cute. i wanted to love this dress but i found it to run large in the top. i'm 5'6 130lb with 34c and i ordered the small  the top just hung off of me. perhaps it would have been better with an xs.
-1,This dress is super bulky and unflattering. the knit is loose and see-through. looks like it was knitted by a five-year old. if you need a dress that adds twenty pounds then this is for you. back to the store it goes
-1,I knew that the cut of this shirt was boxy  but this is huge.  i wear a l or xl at retailer  and i got the m/l and was swimming in this top.  sadly  this will be going back.
0,Nice fabric  very versatile but the knit top and style accentuates your bust. probably not an issue for most but if your a d or up it's more attention than you may want.
0,"Would recommend  but with the caveat that i had to return due to the pants being way too big all over  even the length was more than i expected from the photos online. i am 5'5"" 120lbs narrow hips  usually a 25 in pants (including other level 99 pants i own). i ordered a 25 and i could have pulled them off completely buttoned  plus they went nearly to my ankles. anyhow  the material is really nice  soft and comfy  color was good (i ordered the dark)  and i could imagine they would be super cute"
-1,This top is huge! i'm typically a size 2 or 4. i bought the 2 and its huge. it's wider than it is long. even if i sized down to a 0 it would still be too much fabric. i'm so disappointed! beautiful color and fabric but there's so much fabric. i love a flowy top but this one is way too much. :( i will be returning this top.
1,My absolute favorite dress yet from retailer! i wore it to numerous events this past summer and felt like $1 000 000.! glad it's on sale now for others to snatch up.
-1,I'm returning this cardigan. it doesn't fit me at all. it's shapeless and loose.
0,When ordering this product  i thought it was strange that the mediums were sold out. i went with the small which is generally what i wear. however  these run small and i see why the medium ran out. they are pretty  however  i wish they made them more true to size.
0,I loved this dress and was hoping to keep it. but  for an a-lign dress it was not roomy enough in the hips and the waist was baggy. i think this dress would look great on a very very slim build with straight hips.
-1,Looks great on the model  but in actuality there is way too much fabric; what should be flowy and billowy looks like a tent (or a maternity top on a petite woman). it didn't matter which size  they all fit me disastrously. i love the look and i thought of keeping it and having it taken in  but there's too much fabric under the chest to make it an easy cut/alteration on the side seams. sometimes i wonder who comes up with these patterns  and if they pin the shirts back on the models. if you put a
-1,Looks great on the picture but when it arrived it was a great disappointment  both the colors and style. the material seems great quality but it's stiff and scratchy  the style is very boxy  and as another reviewer said  just hung. i'm a brunette and the colors looked terrible on me. back it goes.
1,I love this jacket. let's be clear though...it's not for warmth just for style but it's perfect for fall in california. i love the detailed work and have already tried this with so many different layers  a light blue tank  off white shirt  tshirt and it looks great with lots of things and truly makes the outfit. love unique pieces like this and i will be wearing it often. i bought my usual size small. sleeves are a bit long for my 5'4 frame but they didn't have in petite and it looks great.
0,"I tried this on in the store and it fit like a tent on me. it doesn't help that i'm 5'1"" and the store didn't have the petite sizes. maybe on a teller person it would work better. or maybe if i had been able to try the petite size it would have more wearable. it is a comfy style and the natural fiber is a plus. i have another holding horses dress that i love which also runs large. i did not mark this as ""runs large"" because the sleeves are more true to size while the bodice is very billowy. i wo"
1,This is a perfect outer layer for chilly mornings or nights. the detail on the back and sleeves is definitely retailer quality. the sleeves do run a little long though.
1,I love this dress! it's super comfortable and can easily be dressed down with a jean jacket and some sandals  or dressed up with leather and a good pair of heels. the fit is spot on and very slimming  and i like that the length isn't too short as well.
1,This is a beautiful skirt. great  soft  draping fabric. fringed along the edges. i ordered size large  which was an okay fit  perhaps a bit wide but the drawstring helps at the waist. because i carry my weight in the tummy  this made me look wider than i am. as an elder  i just couldn't handle the length which hit me right at the top of the widest part of knee. i have great legs but my knees aren't their best feature. so sadly  returned but i do recommend.
-1,This product runs either really small or is super high waisted. either way not for me.
0,I purchased this for a very good price and i typically love maeve... should have been a win-win. the fabric is thin and slinky in the most unfortunate way. it made finding appropriate undergarments very difficult. i had to add a slip (that helped) and figured that since i'm losing weight  it would look better when i'm down a few more pounds. that being said  i didn't find it to be figure flattering. i have a tummy and there was at least one photo from the bridal shower i wore this to  where i lo
1,I recommend this product if you are tall. the pants fit great but they are too long. im 5'7' and they drag on the ground.
0,It didn't work with my frame at all  but is very nice!
-1,I ordered the xl in white. for fit  it's true to size. it matches the model's photos. it's a comfortable top. the shape is good with the pleating. but  the color is definitely off. it's as if the white fabric was pre-washed with navy. it's not the fresh  crisp white shown  at least for the one i received.     the quality of the material is basic. the black version might be the better one overall. i'm going to exchange the white one i have to give that a try. overall  i don't think it's worth ful
0,I think this blouse would work for petites. it is super short and boxy. looked nothing like the fit on the model. sad to return it  love the print.
0,Love the print  length  and cut. but the tie waist hangs in a weird way and seemed like it would stretch out and sag after a while. sad to return it.
1,I recently came across this dress in store and decided to try it on. i immediately fell in love. my husband was patiently waiting outside the dressing area to see it and give his opinion but i knew i was going to get it regardless of his thoughts. :) this dress could be worn with heel  flats  sandals  booties  etc. the one drawback i have is the high cut of the wrapover in front. as other reviewers have said  i plan on wearing this places where i won't be sitting for long periods of time because
-1,This jacket is so cute and fits perfect and i love the motif. however  it deposited black linty particle all over my pants and top and the fabric was already pilling just from being on the hanger in the store. this piece will look bad/worn/old in a very short period of time. it's a big shame  because it's so perfect in every other way. i choose not to buy it. it's very expensive for the quality.
0,I was really disappointed when this arrived and i discovered that it's basically see-through.  it's well constructed  it's just a really thin material.
1,I was in love with this top from the moment i put it on. it is of high quality  with layers to ensure the top isn't sheer. the embroidery is so pretty and the top looks way less grandma in person. i ordered the petite xxs and it fits perfectly. i really appreciate that the underarm holes are just the right size and don't show off any of my bra  which sometimes happens with sleeveless tops. i can wear it with jeans and boots or with a pencil skirt and heels and it looks great with both outfits. o
0,This was so large on me that it looked awful. huge armholes and a baggy mess. material was nice and i loved the design. not sure a smaller size would even help.
1,I love wearing this pullover with leggings and boots. it's soft  comfortable  and loose fitting.
0,I love cashmere  love the length  cowl-neck and colors  however i found the yellow to be bit more vibrant in person  which i liked. i'm not sure i will keep this because it seemed to be a bit too thin for my taste. i would gladly pay a bit more for a thicker ply sweater... i might justify this one at a sale price.
1,Love this color! when i saw this beautiful blue color in the store i had to try them on! so pretty! if you love pilcro chinos--you will be happy with these! same great fit and an awesome color!
1,This shirt is very flattering and drapes beautifully. i am 5'7 175 and the medium fits perfectly. i bought in navy but am disappointed in the other options - i would have bought all of them had they been nice colors but the yellow and orange are really garish and unflattering on any skin tone and the white way too see-through which ruins the visual lines of the top. bummer! but i wear the navy every day so give that a thumbs-up.
0,A little boxy but will be a go to basic. the off set ruffle gives interest
0,"I bought the blue dress  though the ""blue"" dress was a little more like grey according to my husband and i. the quality of the fabric was quite nice.    i have to return the dress because it does not fit me around the bust. i consider myself to have a good size bust (not huge)  but the dress seems to expect quite a bit smaller.     i was initially attracted to the dress because it looked a little more casual  which is what i wanted  but i guess i just wouldn't call it at all pretty."
0,This skirt was cute on  but not particularly flattering. i thought the denim was a little too stiff. typically  a-lines are flattering on my figure  but this was a miss.
-1,The pattern is very adorable. unfortunately the design is flawed. sizing is great at the waist and hip  and the length is spot on  but the top is wide. it's strange because i don't think it would fit someone that was bustier than me either.  will return. i'm considering buying again on sale and having a tailor correct it.
1,First saw this jacket in the catalog  in peach  and had to have it. i received it today  and love it. its a soft  muted peach  very neutral. i ordered xl  im usually a m-l  but decided i wanted it to look big and comfy. the quality is great  feels good on. love it so much  i just ordered it in the dark grey. very classic jacket  will wear for years. one of my favorite hei hei pieces  never disappoints.
1,I knew i had to have this as soon as i saw it pop up in the tops section. it's effortless. love the quirky design and the overall fit. it's a tad on the large side  but i'm all about the flow these days. oh  and the poms at the bottom about sent me over the edge. fantastic piece.
