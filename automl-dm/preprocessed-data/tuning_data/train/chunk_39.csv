0,I ordered this to arrive at my store and was so excited to try it on. it was soft and cuddly  but a little baggy under the arms  and it shed everywhere. underwhelmed.
0,"Uncertain about sizing i got both the 4 & the 6...both made me look like a no-asser :( neither fit quite right in the leg. both hit at a weird point in my calf  not cute-short  just off. (i'm 5'8"" and 125#) to quote my husband  ""nope. not feeling these."" that said  they feel great on  seem to be made well  but are heading back to an retailer near you :( sigh. the quest continues :)"
1,Nice top. armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman  i'm picky about that. the print is pretty and unusual. it just didn't look great on me. there's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely. it's a lightweight tee fabric that's opaque. i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible. great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now  that i decided to return since summer is winding down. i do recommend.
1,I wore this dress to dinner right after my boyfriend proposed to me! it will be perfect to wear to any bridal event like a bridal shower  rehearsal dinner or engagement party. i ordered a size 0 and 2. the mock neck is a bit snug. there wasn't any difference really between a size 0 or 2 so i kept the size 0 since it fit better in the waist. it's beautifully made and feels like it will hold up well. it's casual but still interesting. it felt just a bit above my knees. a perfect length. i paired i
0,This top is very nice. i ordered it in black  it looked very good. the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look. the fabric  however  feels like heavy cotton. it didn't feel very soft and comfortable  it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton. while i think this will retain it's shape and not stretch like softer cotton  i am sending it back. it felt a bit heavy to wear.
-1,Ordered a l and xl  the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose. the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt. both sizes had to be returned.
1,This jacket has great style  is really comfortable  and looks good with jeans or nice pants. i usually wear a small or extra small in all clothes but thought the arms were tight in the small. the medium is a better fit.
1,Luv this top/dress/coverup..runs a lil big...i sized down for a more fitted look to pair it with cropped skinny jeans! fabric is nice  comfortable and light!
1,This tank is soft and flexible. great fit with wonderful material. very pleased.
-1,"Was excited to receive this dress  as it had some great reviews. however  of the love was coming from the 5'5""+ set. as a petite  this didn't work well for me  and the fabric flattened me out in the bust in an awkward way. returned."
0,I really wanted to love this dress. i thought i might be able to dress it up for a wedding i'm attending  but it was kind of a serious no go. first off  i ordered a petite size  but it was still longer than on the model--i'm 5'5'  so not even technically petite  but i thought it might be a better length for me that way. it was not a great length  and the pleats and pockets (which would be great in theory) make the skirt fully (and pouffier at the waist) than i would have liked. i love the way th
-1,"Oh  i wanted this dress to work! i bought it in green  red and the solid blue. all ran really small. i *just* fit in a 10  when i would normally take a 6 in retailer sizes (5'8"" and 140 lbs). as with many other reviewers  i also noticed that the zipper was a huge flaw. it took a long  slow motion to get it zipped because it would get stuck on the fabric variations. such a cute style  was really bummed it didn't work. i kept ordering it in other colors thinking i would hit the jackpot  but they wer"
1,This dress will take you through fall  winter and spring. i love all the stitching and design detail. it has a nice swingy skirt that is quite a bit longer in the back.
0,This is absolutely huge.  it felt like it was at least 2 sizes too big - the empire waist wasn't even semi- fit.  36d chest and size small was like a tent.  however  the embroidery was beautiful
-1,I love the look and feel of the material  but it was way too short - i don't even have a long torso! sadly  it's going back to the store.
0,"I would give it a 3.5 if half star possible. like other reviews said  the material is a little cheap and back zip got stuck when i tried to unzip it before trying it on. overall  nice color and flattering look that could be dress up or down. i am 5'8""  155lbs  36b and m is a little snug for me on the top."
1,First mermaid-ish skirt ever that's flattering enough to pull off with a curvy lower body. the material is light-weight sweater knit that hugs in all the right places and its unique cut along the bottom make it very in the moment. the color is a rich  deep  gorgeous brown with subtle highlights that draw from whatever top you pear with it. runs large so size down.
-1,The dresss is much shorter than described. very see thru  though guess you can tell from picture. expected more for the price.
-1,I was very excited to order this top in red xs. so cute  but it was huge  shapeless and support thin! it had to go back. i should've looked at other reviews.
-1,"This top is a joke unless you are really into expensive clown wear. i thought this looked whimsical  fun and a well-designed piece when i saw it on line--especially at this high price. i started to laugh before i even pulled the entire top of out the bag when i got it in the mail today. it is not expensive looking at all  and the pom poms look like a sad craft project rather than a special detail. it is a bit juvenile too. even if you wore it and were going for ""ironic""  it would be difficult to"
0,I loved the shape of this sweater. the way it draped from the waist was flattering and different. the sleeves were a strange length  however  between long and 3/4 length which made it look like they the sweater was just too short for me. the color looked peachy or pink in the photo  but in reality  it was almost skin tone  which was not flattering with my olive coloring. paler women might find it attractive. the real downside for me was the fabric which was thin with the flowers mainly printed o
0,This would be great on someone with a slim build. it's very true to size  it hits above the hips and runs pretty straight through the body for a boxy look. i loved the color and pointelle detail but on my thicker build it just sort of hung in a too-casual way. note that it is the kind of cotton that is likely to stretch with wear (and spring back with cleaning).
0,Pretty color  great details  awesome stitching.. aaaaannnnnnd it actually not only goes out a line but ballooned out above the hem and then came back in - just too much fabric down below. nice at neck  arms and chest but disastrous anywhere below that.
1,This is a good skirt  although i think the fabric keeps it from being great. it fits well  has a good shape  and drapes nicely. the synthetic material is ok  and i'll keep it  but it may limit the use. i'll wear it to work  but probably not to nicer events.
0,"Love the shape and cut of this top but it is so sheer you could see my belly button through it. if it was a dark color i would buy it. wore my regular size small. i'm 5'5""130lbs  and 32dd."
0,The fit is slightly loose  but figure flattering  the fabric is semi sheer and the light  coral color is very pretty. however  after one  short wear i discovered fabric torn from both sides of the back seam. unfortunately  i need to return this blouse asap.
0,This top is beautiful to look at but did not fit me like the model. it was tight across the bust but very poofy at the bottom  which normally i like  but not this time. sad.
0,The fabric  so diaphanous! so flowy! the pattern  so pretty with such interesting colors. it could literally go with anything! purple  yellow  orange  green  they're all in there. but here's the but....    i have no waist! and when you put this type of empire silhouette on me  i look like i'm wearing a sack  or i have some pregnancy news--when i don't. i tried belting it : waist tie is too high; i tried putting on a vest  too annie hall and called too much attention to the sleeves  while adding
-1,"I ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut. i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more ""denim"" version. the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser  less flattering fit. returned it and kept the regular ag stevie."
1,The fit and style of this dress are beautiful. it's a bouncy fabric that is light and comfortable. i really wanted to love it  but the color just didn't work for me. the pictures make it look like it's a nice cream color  but it's very tan and i can't pull it off with my coloring.
1,I just love this top  it has a flattering cut  fun summer colors! i purchased the white and paired it with the plata chevron skirt. both pieces go with everything and can be dressed up or down. perfect for traveling. only tricky part for me was reaching all the buttons in the back. highly recommend!! stock more pieces like this retailer!
0,"I didn't realize when i ordered  that the hem is unfinished below the seam.. i'm not a fan of this look  especially in a more expensive skirt. the fabric is nice and flowy.. but i do feel there is maybe too much of it(which may be a plus if you wanted a fuller skirt) and that the waist runs slightly small. i am normally a 10-12 and ordered the large and it fit at my natural waist  rather than hanging lower and looser like other styles in this shape. i am 5'7"" and i do like fuller skirts  but was"
-1,I would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker. it's really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress. you can't wear a bra with it because it is backless so i don't understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house.
0,I received the vest and it was pretty much as pictured however  the color isn't quite yellow; it has a little green to it  kind of chartreuse.    i returned the item because it didn't look as good on me as it did on the pictured model. this would probably look better on someone taller than me.
1,My favorite pants! they do run slightly large so i sized down. i have 3 colors and will continue to add more!
-1,I was really looking forward to these tees working  after reading the reviews. unfortunately  they had slits on the sides that came up higher than i was comfortable showing my sides just above my jeans. trying to keep it age appropriate.
-1,I was really excited about this sweater  but the fit was terrible. the sleeves were the right size  but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape. they must have clipped the sweater on the model. for reference  i'm 5'4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small.
1,I loved this shirt from the moment i saw it on the table. i am always too tall for a peplum blouse because they hit my rib cage instead of my waist  but this shirt doesn't have that problem! i have the white one  the polka dots are a really pretty corn flower blue color. i usually wear an 8 in maeve blouses  but this one i took a 6. there is definately no give though. i have a very flat chest and only wear a lacy bralette under this shirt because there is no room for anything else. i am sad thou
0,After reading the reviews i decided to give this a try  but it just didn't work on me. i'm 5'8  smaller on top  and usually wear m in retailer sizes. this was ok in the shoulder and arm area but a little too snug for me in the hips. also  the diagonal striping made my boobs disappear and the pattern at the bottom emphasized my tummy and rear. not exactly the look i was going for. back it goes.
-1,I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling. unfortunately  it just didn't work out. i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front. the top was also boxy and didn't sit right. it just wasn't flattering. cute top on the hanger  but just not on me.
0,...maybe i would've kept this top. i love the print  colors  and design. however  i feel like i had too much of a bosom to wear it. since my bust and torso seemed too large for it  the peplum ruffle bottom lining and top straps did not look good.
1,I really like this dress a lot. the material is soft and comfortable. it is clingy but not in a bad way. the design can camouflage some figure problems. i thought it looked better with a belt so i added a skinny beige/pink belt which worked great. can't say enough about how comfortable this dress is.
-1,Even in my usual petite small size  this looked bulky and made me look stumpy. disappointing because the style looks so good in the picture and the material looks to be good quality. i don't even know if going down a size would have helped. as others have mentioned it looks like a frumpy house robe.
-1,I had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews. first off it runs really small. i usually wear a small or medium ( 4 or 6) i couldn't even get the 6 on. i probably could have even done a 10. the fabric was extremely flimsy. i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off. other than the sizing and the fabric  it just wasn't flattering on me.
-1,This top runs super small in the upper arms  shoulder area..could not even stretch out my arms! ...other then that major problem  the length and body fit were perfect...i am true med and/or large in all retailer tops so i tried sizes 10  12 and neither worked for me due to arm/shoulder fit...disappointed because it really is a beautiful top...
-1,I have been struggling to find a nice flowy summer dress that isn't too short. i am petite but do not like to wear my dresses too far above the knee  so i ordered this in the 00 regular. this dress was not what i expected. it is not flowy  but rather a heavy and stiff fabric. it is also way too wide. it looks like it can't decide whether to be a box or a bag. it is also shorter than advertised. last thing to disappoint was the color - darker and more muted than the photo on the website. i can't
-1,I agree that this shirt is boxy and has no shape; it doesn't look at all like it does on the model. i returned it.
1,These leggings are beautiful and different. the material is very stretchy  sort of a spandex feel. panty lines definitely show in the back. i found they run true to size; i wear a size 6/medium/28 in pants or jeans and the size medium fit me great.
0,"I bought the tiny brand ""cassia"" tank last week in a small  and it fits beautifully. i ordered this ""sorcha"" tank in a small as well and it is huge! i am very sad about the huge size difference. look closely at the photos... the fabric twists as it goes over the shoulders to the back....it is quite bulky. hard to tell if that would minimize in a smaller size. my store doesn't carry this item so i can't easily try another."
-1,I loved the style so i ordered on line. it runs small and the arm inserts are so low its awkward to wear. i wish the cut was better cause i love the look but not the fit. i am returning this item..
1,"Sleepwear is always hit or miss with me. i am 5' 8"" and curvy  and typically sleep pants hit right above my foot and aren't long enough. or they stretch out after a few wearings and look baggy or unflattering. however  this pair exceeded all my expectations! first  they are just plain pretty. the pattern and colors are lovely. the blue at the ankle is a cute touch. the fabric is soft and slightly drapey - but substantial enough for warmth and not see-through at all. i also like how the waist is"
1,Love this dress! very feminine and flattering. i would say that it runs true to size  or a little big. size down for a snug fit at the waist.
-1,I&#39;m taller (5&#39;8)  so it&#39;s not uncommon for things to be too short on me  but this was really short for the style.  it was very wide and loose all over in my usual size - both up top and in the wavy part below.  the style really just did not work with the length.  it looked very odd.
1,This sweater is so soft and comfortable. looks dressy with skirt and booties or casual with leggings and flats.
-1,"I bought the red motiff in my usual size of xxs petite and it was huge. at first i thought they had mistakenly sent the wrong size but this was sadly not the case. the fit is definitely ""sack-like"" as other reviewers mentioned. i had to return."
1,This dress is beautiful in person. i am 5'1 and was afraid it would be too long but it was perfect. i only need 2 inch heel and it will be fine.  details on the flowers are really nice. one more plus it machine washable.
-1,This picture does not represent these jeans .. the color is way off. they are more yellow toned and look much more worn than in the picture. they also run very small.
0,Delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness. loved the unmatched buttons  checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy. easyily dress it up or down  that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight. i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build. ordered a 4 but i think a 6 would have been perfect!
1,I'm wearing this top today at work and i feel very cute walking through the hallways. it's a little long in the back  because i'm short  but overall i enjoy wearing it. it's comfortable  casual  girly  and well made. i'm happy with it.
0,I ordered this top in red. gorgeous color and detail  however just wasn't flattering on my more curvy shape. felt like it looked like a maternity top.
1,These are some of my favorite new pants. i am never disappointed by the quality from this brand and they are super comfortable and adorable. a definite must have!
-1,This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews  but it was way too big. sadly  i had to return it.
-1,Absolutely beautiful top  worn once...hand washed and that's all she wrote..ruined!! the black trim bled all over the top!! i tried everything you could imagine to get this back to normal! do not recommend!! :(
-1,This blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and can't be saved. the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just doesn't lay right underneath. the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse. i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print. definitely not worth the money even at 1/2 off plus 25-%.
0,"I fell in love with these online. i thought they would be such a nice piece of statement denim. unfortunately they did not work for me. i am 5'2"" and the waist of these paints was four inches away from my breasts. it didn't look bad from the back but from the front it was comical. the denim itself is nice and heavy but  like the previous reviewer stated  not a dark wash. the pair i received was a medium whiskered wash. if i was taller these would have been a yes  despite the wash discrepancy."
1,Pretty top. quality material  it is not thin and see  through. size down because this runs large. although it is meant to be flowy  if you don't size down  the arm holes will show your bra and the rest of the body will have too much fabric looking too boxy and unflattering.
1,"This is a really elegant sweater coat--the faux fur trim adds a lot of flair and the ""mismatching"" color blocks on each side keeps things playful. the material is soft and cozy  but my one concern is that the threads can get snagged. otherwise  though  it's a winner!"
1,"Got charlie trousers last year in a different print in my usual size 4 (5'2""  115#). they initially fit perfectly but stretched out in the thighs and waist and now are loose.  this time i bought a size smaller (size 2). they were snug but i felt them stretch during the first wear and they fit fine now.  i recommend sizing down because they stretch out. love the print for summer (i love anything beachy) and had to have it!  nice comfortable material which isn't hot for summer.  got the regular si"
0,First comment about this piece is that it runs unbelievably small  which is not in line with most retailer pieces. i had to size up two sizes to get the size to close  on top of being busty. the material is thin and mildly see thru  but i think the shape it cute and it had a unique look to it with the tiny gold buttons and non-collar top. i decided to keep it.
0,Strange fit if you have a short torso. i ordered a medium petite and the drop waist looked strange  so i tried using a belt and it bunched up. returned the dress. why should a nice simple dress like this create such hard work?!
