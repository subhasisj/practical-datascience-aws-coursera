0,Originally bought the plaid version and retuned it to order this one in the store to get free shipping. the fit is completely different. i am a consistent small  particularly in dresses of this style. will be exchanging this for a medium  which i hope will fit. love the color and pattern.
-1,The sweater runs large  the sweater is designed in such a way that it looks very sloppy. i would never be able to wear it out of the house. however  the material is exceptionally soft and delightful. keeping as its a great stay at home & lounge sweater  but way over priced for this purpose. if you can get the fabric to lay correctly  you're a genius.
0,I ordered 2 dressed in 2 different sizes. neither fit... both were very tight... runs very small.
-1,I tried on and bought this shirt in my usual size and it fit long and loose but still had great shape. after hand washing in cold water and air drying  as per instructions on the tag  the shirt shrunk significantly. so much so that my stomach shows if i raise my arms at all. it also lost its shape  and now looks very boxy and is very unflattering. i won't be wearing it and am disappointed i didn't even get to wear it once!
1,This button down is to die for! the material is incredibly soft and comfy. it looks great with my retailer leggings  and is also a great look with my casual denim  paired with a cardi and flats or booties. i've worn it several times for different looks and always get compliments on it! definitely a head-turning piece.
1,Thin for this late in the season  but the colors are so pretty. i'm going to layer it over a long sleeve t  top with a cardi and pair with leggings. runs large. love the the unconnected slip. 5 stars.
1,"This cardigan is not my usual color choice  but the details were so beautiful i had to buy it when i saw it at the store. the birds and flowers are detailed with sparkly little beads that are prettier in reality than you can see in these photos. it's also a versatile piece that can be worn in many ways and dressed up or down. i'm only 5'1"" but i didn't need the petite (which is good since it is sold out in petite). the sleeves are cropped so they don't hang too low for me. the sweater is hand wa"
0,This is a beautiful sweater and a nice medium weight. however  it is an awkward length. i am tall and have a long torso so it's just not cut right for me and was not flattering.
0,This fit well  but the top was very see through. this never would have worked for me. i'm glad i was able to try it on in the store and didn't order it online. with different fabric  it would have been great.
-1,I wish i had read the reviews before purchasing online. i love how this top looks online but when i tried on the small that i ordered  it was comical. so so boxy. literally  shaped like a square. it must be pinned back on this model. maybe if i ordered an xxxxs it would have worked...or perhaps for a larger person  it may look super cute! just didn't work on my slim build. :(
0,I do think this blazer is comfortable and looks decently cute  but wasn't sure about the fabric. hte coloring is fun too. i decided to pass on it only because of the previous review regarding shedding.
-1,This dress is beautiful and unique - the cutouts and lace really stand out. however  the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers. i usually get a 0 or 0p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the 0 regular was huge and the armholes really big. the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short. while the design is beautiful  there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling. for reference  i am 24 waist
-1,Love the print and was looking forward to this dress. the length and bust are just right in normal sizing  however the 'swing' effect is all off. there's so much fabric. its like wearing a moo moo. not at all flattering. disappointed in this one.
0,The fabric is really itchy  i felt like i was wearing a carpet  and it reminded me of the 70's fabric crimplene. this will not be comfy in humid weather. the top also had a strange synthetic odor.it was returned.
1,I bought this dress as soon as i received the retailer catalogue. i rushed to the store because i absolutely fell in love with it. when i tried it on  i went a complete size down. i'm usually an 8  but i snagged this beauty in a 6. the top part really does run larger  so unless you have really broad shoulders  you'll need to size down. the sleeves hit my arms at a nice place  and the little tie in the front is awesome  because not only is it an interesting detail  it can be loosened or tightened d
0,Too floppy; light and comfortable material but the tie-neck needs a shirt with a bit more structure.
-1,Is not a place i want to be  even if the style of a sweater is great.  yes  this sweater is very cropped  but i think it&amp;#39;s definitely intended to be worn off the shoulder to drop the waist a bit.  it&amp;#39;s the itchiness that makes it an immediate &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;  and that&amp;#39;s coming from someone who has serious fiber itch tolerance.
0,Very soft material  length is great  a little more loose than i would have liked.
0,This is a lightweight knit dress that is well-designed but very form-fitting. i decided to return it because at almost 40 there are parts of my body that i don't need to show  but if you're in great shape or willing to wear shape wear  this would be super cute.
1,The material is a medium weight jersey knit that is slightly thicker so it provides enough coverage and support to be flattering without being bulky. i think this dress is true-to-size  or maybe runs a little bit big  but only by a little bit. i bought a medium and am a size 8 in tops and 10 in pants. the dress hugs nicely on the upper body (arms  chest  ribs) and flares just a little bit on the hips/tummy/butt area. it is forgiving of little bumps or lumps. the scoop neckline is a bit lower tha
-1,I really liked the casual style of this top  but i was disappointed when i put it on.  it's cut weird- the shoulder cut-outs are smaller than pictured and just don't seem to hang right.  they don't hit where they're supposed to and the sleeves were also not as pictured  more like 3/4 which i didn't like.  the color is really nice and i liked the fabric but the fit was just off.  i tried xs and s.  both fit weird.
-1,While this is cozy and well made  the problem lies with the unavoidable exposure of the inside of the poncho  which looks unfinished. had the inside been lined or had the hue of the stripes continued through the material  the draped look of this piece would be gorgeous. unfortunately  the faded backside of the pattern (a glimpse of it under model's left hand)  viewable through the very large arm holes (and impossible to hide)  disrupts the effortless  fluid feel that a poncho should have. i was
1,Love this shirt  very flattering fit on my pear shape. also accommodates my larger 32dd bust without straining on the buttons. ever so slightly sheer fabric  but no cami needed if wearing a nude bra.
1,Absolutely stunning design with the eyelet lace top!  it's a very romantic  comfortable top that has a flattering fit. i'm so glad that it has lining so i don't need to be concerned about exposing myself to anyone.  it has a light fabric so it's very comfortable in the summer heat and humidity in florida.
0,I love boiled wool and have gotten a few items from retailer in years past that i have loved. this one was a fail. i typically wear a small and it was slightly too big and shapeless for me. i am 34c  127#. the moment i put it on  it felt like i was wearing a bathrobe. it flares quite a bit  and the stitching is brown and not dark grey like i was hoping. the quality is as expected. the color overall is as it looks online. but it was a return.
1,Amazing dress! i'm a pear shape  and this dress is a very complimentary cut for me. it's also not too short. the color print on the dress are amazing. i'm very happy!
-1,I loved the design online but the sweater is bulky and boxy. i had chosen the cream with blue and now looking back at the other pictures of the beige/cream it represents it better. it made me look very wide. loved it online but it wasn't for me  returned it.
1,Nice  thick material. cream has lining underneath which i appreciated so that it's not sheer in the light.  flattering design
0,I love the quality and colors of this romper; however i have a long torso and the top part was just too short for my body style. it made the bottom part pull as well. overall the fit just wasn't right for me. i did love the material and it is a very nice piece.
1,Great tunic!  i get compliments every time i wear it. :)
-1,I love jumpsuits for their style and comfort. i loved the look of this blue silky piece  and the review that said it was like lounge wear you could wear out of the house. i agree that it is like lounge wear  but for me  there were a few challenges.    first  the fit was small. i am usually anywhere between a 2 and a 6 depending on style  cut and brand. i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel. it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th
-1,The tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes. to my surprise   the tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest area.  the appliques/laces on the front are made of low quality materials.
-1,This really was nothing special. for $68 there are much cuter tops at retailer. it wasn't particularly flattering as it was very boxy  so it added volume. it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice. i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big. overall  this was just a miss for me.
1,I ordered christmas presents online this year. they arrived very quickly and were well received! they are ferry pretty!!! i will order online again!!!
0,This sweater has potential  but it wasn't right for me. the collar isn't flattering on me...too thick  and my shoulders are already broad. my waist is high  so i need a longer look. the color is true to size  but it's s little see through...dark bra shows through.
0,"I love the idea of this coat and foolishly purchased other items in happy anticipation of its arrival.    the description does not say ""lined "" and i hoped for soft wool that i recently got on the ""yellow with white piping"" sweater coat. this is hard  coarse  itchy wool - impossible for me to wear an unlined garment. i am consistently puzzled by the high prices for garments that are unlined when they really need to be. it went back  and i cannot really recommend this as i know i am not the only"
-1,I ordered these jeans twice because i love them. the first pair were mis-marked by about 4 sizes so i re-ordered. second pair still didn't fit  they run really small  i would probably need one maybe two sizes larger than normal to achieve the fit and feel of the other skinny jeans in my closet:(
0,"I love the details and design of this top- my only issue is the top is a bit too ""flowy""."
0,The blue is a very flattering color. the fit is not. it does not lay in the back like in the photo on the model. instead  there is a lot of fabric that falls in horizontal folds because it does not fall straight because the sides at the bottom are narrower than the mid section. i think i'm going to return it. the neckline is very nice and faltering. the sleeve at the wrist is kind of constricting  though  and long. it doesn't run big at the chest section  just the mid section  then tapers in at
1,"I adore the tiny brand blouses! this one is lovely  and i feel new and beautiful in the navy with the sheer sleeves and bumpy  embroidered material  very pretty indeed. this probably is equally stunning in the nude color  but it doesn't show well somehow online. the navy is certainly amazing  and i was so proud to wear this blouse today for work with jeans. i always find the tiny sizing to be one size off. the large fits me perfectly  although i am a medium in most all other tops. 5.1""  130 #  3"
-1,I bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes. it runs big so size down at least 1-2 sizes. i didn't realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat. that part of the coat is really nice and comfy. unfortunately  the rest of the coat (the wool part) is very itchy. it would've been awesome if it was lined on the inside  but it's not...so i'm taking them back.
-1,I love the way these shorts fit and look; very comfy  but after laundering one time  the lavender color became blotchy. used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas & they are unwearable! i have several colors  but the only color that was a problem is the lavender. $58 for one wear was a waste. i hate to leave negative feedback  but be careful with laundering.
0,"I loved the pattern  color and mock turtleneck style of this top  but it was just too short on me. i purchased the xs in the ivory color (i am 5'5""  32d  110 lbs for reference). i had planned to layer this under jackets for work  but every time i raised my arms  you could see my stomach. i would not have felt comfortable wearing it to work because of this. the fit was slightly boxy also  and it was not flattering when i tucked it into a skirt because the boxy shape caused the shirt to bunch up s"
1,As always these pilcro pants did not disappoint. i can always order a size 26 and know they will fit like a custom pant. i actually like the fit on me better than shown on the model. there is no crotch hang like in the photo. i need to wear heels with these because of the length but heels and flares are very slimming.
-1,I wanted to love this dress. i saw it in the catalog in blue  and wanted it. however  for some reason i took my sweet time in ordering it  and by the time i did  only the orange was available: but on sale. i was so excited when it arrived  and as i was trying it on  i thought  this is a bit shorter in the skirt than i usually go but it's so pretty... and then i couldn't get my right arm in the sleeve at all. i wondered if i had caught some of the lining as i was putting it on or something  but n
0,I agree with the other two reviews. it is so disappointing that this adorable dress isn't lined. the fabric is paper thin! this is an a-line style dress with pockets that need to be ironed down to prevent it making you look hippy. i sized down to a petite xs. i normally buy the petite smalls but they were out of it. i would say that this dress runs a little on the large size.
1,This dress is even better in person. the base color of the fabric is a very light peach  and very lovely. as you can see from the photos  the green floral pattern running up the front of the dress varies slightly from dress to dress  but i found the front on mine was very similar to the 1st photo. the bright green flowers are a light mint green  which plays beautifully with the light peach. there are more details in the print to discover in person  which is a nice bonus. the silk is not stiff li
-1,This runs super big and it just wasn't flattering--way too much fabric. i wanted to love this dress.
0,I like how this jacket is very versatile. you can wear it to work  or play. it does have interesting detail on it  i kept it based on the price and those details. i have the olive color. the arms are a little tight.
0,This dress is so pretty in the photos but in person it's huge. and not in a way i could adjust by sizing down. the shoulders and arms fit but the body of the dress is absolutely huge. i normally love a trapeze dress but i was swimming in this so it was quite unflattering. it was also much longer than it looks on the model. i'm not short - in fact dresses are normally a bit shorter on me than the average person but this was just frumpy.
-1,"I just received this in the mail today. first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer. the description says ""viscose lining"" so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color. second of all  it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope. the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said. i ordered a size smaller than us"
1,I immediately loved the rich royal blue color of this sweater with its pretty flower  nice fabric and medium weight. nice warm sweater.i have an retailer skirt just like the photo  great outfit. i am happy i ordered it  but hope it shrinks after washing.the small is very big and boxy  sleeves long. i am 5'6 medium build. small usually fits me well. i recommend downsizing or you will probably take this back.
1,I saw this dress on someone and knew immediately i had to have it.  it is stunning in person.
0,Kinda a boxy looking sweater. it definitely made me look really large and just couldn't see myself wearing it very often. ended up returning it.
1,Ok  so this is true to size-- i recently had a baby (i gained a lot of weight)  am in the process of losing it and took the risk of buying a jumpsuit online. i am 5'3 with a long torso  short legs  and a big fat butt so buying pants (especially rompers) are almost impossible. lengthwise  this fits me like pants. the draping is so flattering and the color combination is splashy but not loud. i had to review this as soon as i realized it fit. i don't think i've ever been so happy with an retailer pu
0,This top is a nice color and soft material  but is much more of a swing top style than i was looking for. i will return it  but it could be ideal for someone who wants a very loose fitting casual look.
-1,I'm 5'2-5'3 which is supposed to be the max height for pieties in retailer (former employee) and while the bodice hit right  the skirt was insanely long. not even with heels is this gonna be right. and no discount towards hemming? i'll wait until this hits the sale rack  which it will because concensus is  it's way too long.
1,I found this top at the beginning of the summer and waited until it was on sale to snag it but honestly wish i had gotten it sooner and paid full price. it's perfect with navy shorts or white jeans and can dress up or dress down. it's a little bit short on the bottom but definitely still flattering. i would recommend it to anybody looking for something to throw on for an easy outfit. definitely worth the sale price!
0,"This top is gorgeous in person  but when i tried it on  i fell out of love. it didn't happen immediately  but the more i wore it around the fitting room area  the less i appreciated its beauty. i tried it on in an xs - i typically wear a s or xs in most retailer tops - 5'8""  140 lbs for reference. this top is just huge in the body! the fit is very boxy and just not flattering. yes  it could be cute with skinny jeans and perfect for preggo's! this was just a miss for me."
-1,I just got this and couldn't wait to wear it to work today. it is such a pretty designed top. unfortunately  it is falling apart as i write this review. one sleeve is unraveling. there are strings hanging off all over the lacy arms. am so disappointed in the quality. i'll be sending it back when i get home.
-1,Great color  soft fabric  but waaaaay too long. more like a night shirt than a t-shirt.
-1,I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail  the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.
-1,I love the colors. however  $200 is a lot to pay for a small piece of fabric   no lining what so ever. the fabric is very thin. you will need a slip. looks just like a cover-up. going back.
1,I love this shirt except that the hook that keeps it close doesn't work a lot  outside of that i love it. i typically wear a small or extra small and with this shirt the extra small was perfect.
1,This looks just as pictured. it's comfortable but dressy. i love it!
1,"I purchased this dress in the navy and white stripe. i did purchase the petite since i'm 5'2"" and it worked out great. very nice style  comfy and flattering. looks great with a pair of boots. one of my go to dresses for sure."
-1,I love relaxed-fit wide leg pants with some pockets and draw string  so naturally i was super excited to see these. i got them in gray and they felt and looked perfect right out of the bag  material was soft and flowy but not too thin. unfortunately the sizing is completely off unless i got a defective pair  i got my usual size l and they felt like s or smaller  i barely could get them on and i could not zip up. i'd need at least two sizes larger for them to fit at all. very disappointed  will l
0,Received this dress  the sleeves are very pretty  the drape was just what i was looking for  but the overall dress was not very flattering on me. i am a little busty on top so it pulled in a unflattering way. i would say that if you are tall and not on the busty side this could be an amazing dress on. this one had to go back
1,"This top is full of amazing details. the photos really don't do it justice. it is very flowy and does run large but is so pretty and soft and in beautiful shades of blue. i bought a small and it is fairly long in back on my 5'5"" frame but because of the detailing...it just works."
1,Soft and cozy  not itchy at all  and it has pockets! i am 5'3  120lbs  34dd bra and take this in size small.
1,I could live in this top: it's versatile enough to be dressed up or down or worn as a bottom layer; the color offerings are basic enough to match anything; and it's comfortable enough to wear around the clock. note that it runs small. i had to size up to a medium  even though 80% of everything else i wear is size small.
