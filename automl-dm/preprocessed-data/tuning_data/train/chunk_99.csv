-1,Ordered the biggest size available  the large. the arms are so tight  i couldn't get it on. looked like it may have fit in the body so i don't understand why so constricting in the arms. i don't have big arms  either. fabric is thin but the color is pretty. can't recommend. i'd pass on this one.
-1,I can not imagine the cut in the waist being flattering on anyone. i ordered an xs and an xxs still would have flared too much in the waste. i ignored the previous review and that was a huge mistake!
1,I'll admit  it's been a few months since i've shopped at retailer. i feel like i have to try on just about everything because there doesn't seem to be much consistency between the brands. i'm so glad i wandered in our local store this week! this top is so beautiful in person and well-made. the embroidery is lovely and it's lined  so not too sheer. i'm tall and it was a good length  hitting just above the hip. i think it runs tts or maybe just a tad big. the s fit perfectly across the chest 
1,Bought this skirt in the light plum color. nice soft corduroy fabric.  it fit well. not too short.   will be cute this fall with a sweater and boots.   my only complaint. i wish it had pockets.
0,This top looks good on model and has great reviews online. however it did not work on my bodytype. when i tried it the slit in the front sat too low. i don't like showing cleavage because i dress conservatively. other than that i would have loved wearing it. arm cut is not too big such it shows sides of bra bands. overall fit is loose and drapery.
1,This is a cute top. not perfectly made  a little boxy  but also not a crop top on me (5'5). it looks cute with high waisted jeans.
-1,I was so excited to try these on at my local retailer. i'm so glad i did before i ordered them online because i found the fit to be totally off. the pants bulged around my hips and looked very awkward. they were also not as soft as i expected them to be.
0,I took this too to the register thinking it was marked down to same price as another tee by the same brand. it wasn't so i ended up paying way too much for a thin tee. will probably return.
1,What a lovely top! the embroidery makes this simple top very special. it's too light-weight for january but will be a staple of my wardrobe come spring.
1,This dress is casual enough to throw on as a cover up and dressy enough for a night out. it so comfy and versatile. will never go out of style. it does run large  but that is just the style of the dress. it really is the perfect summer dress.
0,"Super long even at 5'7"" and a little too voluminous for my taste. incredibly comfortable and beautiful pattern though. i'm having a hard time imagining there getting much use for me  so even at the sale price they're going back."
1,I fell in love with this tunic on instagram  and couldn't wait to find it during the tops promotion. it was absolutely not a disappointment. as the other reviewer mentioned  the colors of the embroidery are brighter than they appear in the online images  and this actually makes the shirt more beautiful--they're rich and fallish  but not at all over the top.    i'm thrilled with the quality and overall cut of this tunic. i would agree that it might be best to run to a larger size in a range--i di
0,I love the length of this and that i can wear it with skinny jeans or leggings  but it does seem to run a little small and it is not as long as on the model. i do think it is a cute addition to my wardrobe though.
-1,I bought this top in the blue motif and loved it so so very much until i washed it. it came out of the wash (delicate/cold cycle) with 3 small holes. i am devastated because it was destined to be my favorite top for summer. it is flattering  lightweight  gorgeous color  cool raw edges  v-back detail...i could go on and on about all the things i love about this top  but now it has holes after one washing so it's all for naught. do-over please with better fabric qa.
1,Iordered hte petite after trying the rregualr size in the store  and i will have to wear heels with the pants... or get them hemmed... the color choices are all great  i wanted navy  but i have a pair of grey ones that look similar  so i deciced on the netural if my size is stil lavaialble in yellow at sale time  i will be grabbing those as well.    i went with 25  my typical size lately (115 lbs)
0,I love the design of this sweater and ordered it online  but was disappointed with the quality of the yarn when it arrived. also the color was a little different than i expected from the photo  still a type of ivory  but a little yellow-y. the sweater was solid looking  but the yarn seemed a bit cheap and i'm not sure how well it would have worn over time. flattering cut. i liked how it fit  but for the price and fabric  i decided to return it. unfortunate to lose money on shipping.
0,Dress is very pretty  but very short  almost tunic length.
1,The red detail at the shoulders is pretty  and i liked the contrast between the red and white. the fabric is soft and comfortable. it is a sweater knit fabric  more substantial than you might guess from photos. the sleeve ruffles were a little poofy for me  and combined with the loose fit it made me feel a little too girl-ish. this could work for you if you are looking for a peasant style blouse with a forgiving shape and nice details  but it wasn't quite right for me.
0,"I tried this dress on in the store. it looked frumpy. the ruching was not flattering. the fabric felt cheap. i think for the price there are plenty of other options for dresses than can give you a ""wow"" look. i'm 5'1"" 107lbs and the 0p fit fine."
-1,I loved this dress when i saw it online  perfect for a summer wedding  but when i tried it on i was very disappointed. the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured. there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely  it made me look very large. i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail. sadly  it will have to go back. it may look good on a very thin frame but didn't complement my average one.
0,The arm holes are just weird .. a little too big for me was just 'off'... back it goes.
-1,Super cute dress but the waist band is very large and bulky.
-1,Gorgeous color and great price  but too low cut and because of the design  a cami's wouldn't work. disappointed
0,I had such high hopes for this  but the fit was really strange. i ordered my usual size small  but it is huge. the sides of the top are very wide and boxy  and the back hangs far from my body  very droopy. even if i got a smaller size  the design/fit is not for me. i like the linen front of the blouse  though it is quite sheer. the fabric on the back has a pretty design  but it appears to be stamped on thin black cloth  rather than the richly-colored fabric i saw in the picture. i am truly disap
0,Great item and very feminine. can be dressed up or down and fits true to size.
1,I thought this sweater was pretty and soft and would be comfortable to wear. i really liked the high collar and the interesting poncho-like design. but the sleeves were a bit short on me. and i thought it was a little pricy. i decided against it for those reasons. but if you don't mind those things  then you might like it. it's definitely worth the try.
0,Ok  if i had a different body  this would be awesome but i have a big butt and meaty thighs so just did not flatter me. although my husband couldn't tell that the pants were tugging on me (thanks to the pattern it does camouflage)  it was uncomfortable. so if you are built like me  this isn't the jumpsuit for you.     this is a well made garment but there is no give in the butt and thigh area (hence would not recommend for my thick thighed sisters).     for reference  i am 5'3 and 150 pounds. th
0,I was so excited to receive this shirt. it is a beautiful color and material and very well made. i loved the lace detail and wanted to love the shirt. however  i put it on and the seem hit right at the top of my bust. it broadened my shoulders and the fabric started right at my bust so it flowed down from there making me look boxy and wide. i am a 32dd  5'3  and 115 pounds for reference. if you are more narrow and don't have a chest this would be absolutely adorable but sadly for me it had to go
-1,Fabric much heavier than looks in picture. also nothing mentioned in the description. great color and fit but i live in florida.
0,I knew there was a problem when my dress arrived and the small fit perfectly when i was 9 months pregnant...i even bought a small even though i normally wear medium i bought it for family pictures once my daughter was born but it made me look like i was still pregnant even though i had already lost all the baby weight in 3 weeks. it is a beautiful dress though and may try to get it altered to see if that works
0,These sleep pants are very pretty  soft and comfortable. unfortunately  after washing them once i noticed some small holes in the fabric which is very disappointing considering the price. i don't mind paying a little more for clothing if i feel like the quality is there but in this case i'm not so sure. i guess if you don't really sleep in them or wash them then they would probably be ok but then what's the point of buying them?
-1,Hei hei is my favorite line. i am a medium in all of the pants i have ever purchased from this brand.  i ordered these in the green and they arrived today. they fit me as if they were an xxl. i have a similar pair in rust from last summer so i assumed that they would be the same.   obviously they are going back tomorrow . i'm very disappointed  they are a nice looking jogger and the color is pretty.
1,The embroidery is breathtaking. it is more flattering and interesting in person. i would highly recommend it!. it is true to size  figure flattering  and unique. the only reason i gave it four stars for quality is because the neck is a little itchy. if you are looking for a show stopper and conversation piece  this is it!
-1,"But like other reviewers said  it looks nothing like the picture of the model. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs  i usually wear an xs in maeve and i ordered the xs petite - the straps are not adjustable so the top part of the dress is up too high and then there is just so much material  it looks like i'm 6 months pregnant. and i usually love loose dresses like this  but the way this falls really does make you look like you are hiding a sack of potatoes. so bummed  because the material is beautiful and i lo"
-1,Love retailer's kimonos and when i saw this pattern i had to have it! unfortunately  when i bought it the tag was already showing holes so they gave me 15% off... went to wear it for the first time  there was already a huge snag in it! i love retailer but for 98$ this is not worth your money.
0,Not what i expected. they ran very small and the fabric seemed cheap for the price. returned.
-1,The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded  which is nice i suppose  but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd  size 8 in pants  and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso  which probably didn't help.
-1,These are way oversized! i have several pairs of pilcro jeans and these run way too large. wasted money on shipping. won't do that again:(
1,I love this shirt so much i bought it in another color. it looks like it does in the picture  loose and flowy.
-1,"I was really excited about this dress. i had only seen it online and it looked like the perfect transitional piece  casual or dress up. when it arrived in the mail  the feel of the fabric was great and i slipped it on and it was so comfy i felt like i was wearing a nightdress. unfortunately it hung like that  too. the material sags in places it shouldn't. i have a 5'8"" 125 lb frame  and i ordered an extra small  and both my husband and sister said it was unflattering and urged me to send it back"
1,I am 9 months post baby and still have some body self-confidence issues. i am just not ready nor do i think i want to ever wear a two piece again so i was looking for something that was still made me feel attractive. this swimsuit does the trick. makes me chest looks awesome and my tummy super flat. love this suit!!!
1,I have this in darker blue and it is my favorite dress of the season. i didn't realize that there was one in turquoise until it was already sold out. please bring back or be so kind to contact me if an xs comes in as a return  etc.   i love this so much!
-1,This dress had an odd fit. very loose on top with pointy darts  very tight on bottom. fabric was stiff so it didn't move well with me
0,These jeans look slouchy and shorter in the pic which was exactly what i was looking for  but they fit more like regular boot cuts on me and proved to be much longer than expected. i have fairly long legs and most jeans hit me like they do on the models  but these were very long. i only buy citizens of humanity and paige jeans and i can almost always buy online for them when it comes to skinny jeans  but these did not fit the same as their other styles. they are good quality and would probably f
1,This is a really great top. it is really soft and made very well. it could be a casual top with jeans  or  dress up with some chunky jewelry and cute heels. i wasn't sure which size to get because i mostly get mediums amd i sometimes get a large. i ended up going with a large and it seemed to be just a little too big  but it doesn't have that look at all. it looks so much better in person than on the computer. overall a very cute top!
-1,I thought these pants were cute! when i put them on  they fit perfectly  and were comfortable  however i wore them for about 20 minutes and they were a completely different size  and looked awful!
-1,As much as i buy from retailer  this is my first review. the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person. i wanted something that was a bit flowy  but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie. the most unflattering dress ever and since it's only available online  i'm not interested enough to try a smaller size.
1,I'm happy to say i got this on the sale rack but had been eyeing this long before.  it is a flattering fit on me in size large.  i just love the colors in the print!  also  the style is not a basic shell but a very feminine cut.  the skinny straps are also a very nice touch.  i plan on wearing this with my long white linen skirt  denim capris or with shorts.  i think i will also opt for a solid cardi or scarf.  this is just so pretty!
1,This rich color is so flattering!  i also love that it has pockets and can be worn to dressy events or can be worn in more casual settings.  the side stripes give it a young and interesting touch.  the elastic waste makes it comfortable so i know i will get lots of use out of this.  i knocked off one star because of the price.  i plan on paring this with tan sandals and a dark denim blazer to start off with.
0,What a huge disappointment! i was really looking forward to wearing this top but it is very tight and awkward around the bust. if you have any semblance of a chest  this is not for you! i am a 38c and this was a no go. the quality of the top seems to be top notch but the fit was just no. it felt restrictive and it was hard to even move my arms and i have slender arms.
-1,This is another item i've been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available. i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i didn't even try it on because i knew it would be going back. the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric. the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim. so much potential just executed poorly.
-1,I am not sure who would look good in this dress. it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone!
0,Bought this shirt because i loved the cut and the stripes. had little to no shape to it. some may think it runs big but it appears that is the look this top is going for. i feel like being short  i just looked kind of dumpy on me. fabric is nice but borders on see through. it was just ok....nothing exciting.
1,Great lightweight summer top that's bra friendly.  i bought the teal color yesterday and wore it today with white skinnies.    i'm sometimes a small and sometimes a medium and was fine with the small on this one
-1,Pretty fabric  nice style  took it back.
0,Was excited about this sweater but it really didn't wow me when i put it on. the v-neck is quite low and the sweater is a bit short. loved the ideas of the fringe but in the end  it went back.
1,I love these shorts. they're really comfortable and versatile. i got them on sale  and for the price they were a steal! the material is nice  and you can dress them up or down.
0,I was so in love with these when i saw them online. they arrived today  and while the fit was great  i was disappointed. the colors are definitely more drab in person than what's pictured in the photo. the material is very thick. it's soft and they'd be warm in cold weather  i'm sure. i liked them  but they were underwhelming. if they were less expensive  i would probably keep them because i liked the fit and they'd be a quirky alternative to what i usually wear to work  but sadly  back they go.
-1,I was so excited when i ordered this  i love comfy clothing this looked perfect! when i received it  there was a weird smell with the top. convinced that this could be from storage or something  i washed it. the smell did not go away. i have washed it 3 times now and the smell will not disappear! i have not yet worn but as i have washed it  not able to return it. the top looks and feels great - just the weird smell. now i am 'stuck'!!
1,"I bought this skirt for an end of summer ""caribbean"" party. the floral detail is even more fun in person. it looks great with a red top or black tank."
0,"This dress has so much potential but doesn't make it.  i read all the reviews and very few were favorable and still took my chances. fabric color and textures is great but the design is really off.  with the little folds on the shoulder and since the fabric is more on the thick side  all this make it to accumulate the ""extra"" weight on the front of the body and as result ""not flattering"" for the majority of ladies including me  it is a shame since it has may great features  the style: flowy  low"
1,I love the coziness of this sweater. i do think it is designed for a looser fit  but i sized down for a closer fit. the sleeve design is unique and flattering i think  kind of of like a cap sleeve would be if you were wearing a long sleeve shirt under it. i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does shed some  but has so many other positive features that i am keeping it and plan to wear it with lighter colors so i don't need to worry about it. just lovely really  love the blue color especially
1,I saw this online and thought it was so pretty--so i ordered a large even though i'm usually a medium in retailer shirts. i thought i might need the extra room to layer. i was in the store returning something and they had a medium and a large so i tried both and the large was way too big in my shoulders and chest even with a sweater! the medium was a little tight in my hips-but still fit. overall the medium was more flattering on me. so i recommend ordering your regular size. it is such a pretty v
0,I like the style and the design of this culottes  but the texture of the fabric will caught on any rough surface. i had a few loose loops for just one wear... so it will be nice to wear for work or shopping   but not good to go to the park or play with kids...
-1,With all of the glowing reviews of this dress  i so badly wanted to adore this very special cocktail dress. it fit nicely  the quality was great  but there is a decorative (?) line of hook and eyes down the front which come undone with the slightest movement. i wore the dress out one time and was paranoid the entire time  kept glancing down to make sure i hadn't come undressed. i suppose i could've gotten out the needlenose and crimped them all shut  but decided to take it back. i didn't see tha
-1,And not in a good way. everywhere i went  i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on  i was picking balls of fabric off the couch  bed  and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style  fabric and fit (although a little on the long side ) but there's no way i can keep it.
1,Very cute. a size small worked perfectly for me  fits like a glove. it has open sides so i wear a tank top under it.
1,This dress fits beautifully. it is warm and comfortable. winter's gem.
0,Beautiful but big. i exchanged my 0 for a 00  and  oddly enough  there was no difference! had a similar experience with another 00 blouse. am i crazy  or is the 00 size just a sham?
0,I'm 5.1 and always bought 27p. they didn't have petite anymore  so i bought 27r  knowing that it'll hit my ankle instead of being cropped. it's very cute as an ankle-length with some flare. my only issue is that the 27r was very tight around the crotch and upper thigh. it's a very tight fit just right there!... and not enough of stretch to be comfortable when sitting. i wonder if it will stretch out a bit more from wear? i then ordered a 28r to see if that fits better  and it fits a tad loose ev
