-1,This top is too short  so much so that tucking it in would be difficult. the designs are lovely  but the short length is putting this top back on the rack.,Blouses
-1,Absolutely beautiful top  worn once...hand washed and that's all she wrote..ruined!! the black trim bled all over the top!! i tried everything you could imagine to get this back to normal! do not recommend!! :(,Blouses
-1,I didn't really understand the other reviews until i received mine in the mail. i love cloth & stone and this is just not up to their normal quality. i bought the blue and yellow colors of this blouse. it's very soft  but the blue already had strings coming from under the arms and i hadn't even tried them on yet. material is super soft  but thin. cut is weird under the arms and tight. sleeves are also tight! i am usually an xs or s in cloth & stone so i ordered smalls. i just fit the arms  but t,Blouses
-1,"I thought this was adorable on the model  but not so much on me. i actually didn't mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan  but i didn't want to keep it for 1 look. the material felt inexpensive. the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself. i'm 5'8"" and about 160 lbs.",Blouses
-1,Maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers. usually fall in love with a blouse  only to look at the tag and discover it's by maeve (go figure).  this top is just atrocious though. does nothing for girls with a larger chest. very boxy and unflattering. gorgeous colors though  and the sleeve concept is cute. however  where the sleeve meets the shirt looks cheap and thrown on. not impressed.,Blouses
-1,Didn't work on this curvy gal.  sizing up would have helped with the button gaps  but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.  major pass.,Blouses
-1,This blouse is a disappointment . fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off. just odd. sleeves awkward . the back of the white shirt on the on-line model is not the same as the white shirt i received. mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white. no ruffle. returned.,Blouses
-1,And hits below my waist just far enough to make my thighs look enormous. i think how it fits depends alot on body type. the material is nice  color pretty  not cheap looking so i will keep it but must wear a topper to slim down thise ugly thighs of mine.....,Blouses
-1,Material was a tad rough for my liking. the color did nothing for my olive complexion. given the price of this shirt (even with 20% off) i don't think it's worth it. if i'm spending $100+ on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this one...going back.,Blouses
0,This may be lovely on some people but it didn't work on me at all. i thought it would have some swing to it but the bottom hem was tight. if i had gone up a size  the top would have been huge. the bib wasn't flattering on me and it's also quite sheer. too bad because the print is great. maybe if you're athletic with slim hips you can manage it. i think if you are busty this could look like maternity wear on you. back it went  sadly.,Blouses
0,Love the top design  not so much the fabric. i should've read the top was 100% polyester. returning and finding a better quality top.,Blouses
0,This shirt has a vibrant color and beautiful neck line  but unfortunately i had to send it back. it is short waisted with a lot of material in the back. had it been 1-2 inches longer it may flare out  but based on the length on me  it ended up looking like a shrunken tent. for reference  i am 5'8 with a long torso.,Blouses
0,"I've been searching for a pretty and unique ""party top"" and thought this was it. it is beautiful and unique but much too cropped for me and i'm only 5'3"". sadly i had to return. maybe would be more appropriate on someone younger",Blouses
0,This top was really cute on someone else  but not on me... on me  ti was too big and the color washed me out. the fabric is nice and the pattern and colors are nice too  just not on porcelain skin... like many tops this season  it is a bit boxy  but looks nice with jeans  white shorts or half-tucked into a skirt. i would probably size down a bot...,Blouses
0,This item states you should wash in cold water and tumble dry low heat. it shrunk after first wash in cold water and i didn&#39;t even use the dryer. do not wash. real bummer..,Blouses
0,Love the shape of this top and often look to retailer for corset-style summer tops that are pretty. this top is made from a thick  stiff fabric that doesn't breathe. so my usual size xxs was too constricting. tried an xs also and it basically fit but i still wasn't a fan of the very heavy fabric in a summer top. it's almost like a neoprene. the colors are an odd choice and not my favorite either. i wanted to see in person and they just don't cut it for me. would love in different colors and softer,Blouses
0,"I really liked the look of this top online  but when it came i had a couple of issues with it. first  when i tried it on i found the underarms to be a little snug (i normally wear a 10/m  and that's what i ordered). it makes raising my arms tough  and as a teacher  i need to be able to lift my arms above my waist. secondly  my husband's first reaction was that it ""looks like pajamas."" the abstract floral/stripe gets a little lost.  on the other hand  the color palette is very pretty and the qual",Blouses
0,I tried this on in my usual size and it was tight through the chest because of the lining. i would have preferred to wear a cami beneath and then it may have worked. the color and pattern are gorgeous  the fabric feels a bit weird  kind of dry and rough? would have liked to see this in a longer length  and more tapered. it is an absolute pregnant top. so sad its so pretty!,Blouses
1,"This is a wow! so chic...reminds of something i would have bought in paris. worth every penny. even my husband loves it on me...his words were ""it's a standout"". i work in the design industry so i am always looking for something that represents what i do...nailed it!",Blouses
1,"I really like this blouse. it's hard to find a short sleeved button down that the sleeves don't stick out and look weird. this one does not have this problem. it is a bit sheer  but i don't mind wearing a cami with it. it is flowy... but not boxy/baggie. has a very nice  flattering drape. i'm 5'3""  110lbs.  32c  petite frame. the 00 regular fits great. i'm often a petite (especially in pants and long sleeved tops)... but went with the regular size here bc i wanted the longer length.",Blouses
1,This is my favorite top! it is gorgeous  soft  & oh so comfortable. it's not too tight & works with leggings  jeans  or as an over-shirt. love it!,Blouses
1,Love this top! i'm 5' 118 lbs  purchased in a medium and plan on wearing it as a dress! it is so cute!,Blouses
1,I was very impressed with the quality of the satin. this top can easily be dressed up or down. i purchased the white and love it! the almost full zip back makes for easy on and off. i ordered a medium and think it runs a little big.,Blouses
1,This top is gorgeous. the colors are lovely  design and quality are impeccable  and it is versatile. this top just happened to catchc my eye and i am so happy with my purchase. it fits tts. i love it!!,Blouses
1,This top is super cute  nice and light for the hot weather  with a tts fit. the model is wearing a light-colored bra  so it shows through. but  with a black bra  there is no problem.,Blouses
1,In maeve i run between a size 2-4.  my regular size 4 was too tight in the shoulders  the fabric didn't drop off the shoulders like it does on the model.  it also felt too tight near the back were the button is  almost as if there was not enough fabric.  the sleeves were also too short and tight around the arms.  sized up to a 6 and all those issues were fixed.  since this top is billowy anyway the size up really didn't mess with the shape of the top.  love the gold color  so pretty!,Blouses
1,"I love the colors. originally purchased a large for my broad shoulders and it was too big and too long for 5'4"". exchanged it for a petit medium and it fits great. will have to wait for cooler days to wear it since it is a heavy cotton and the weather is still very hot intexas.",Blouses
-1,When i wore this the two times i did  i got a ton of compliments. it runs small  and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning. after the second wear  the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable. i have to return it and am so disappointed. sadly  i would not recommend buying it for that reason.,Dresses
-1,This dress is so cute! i went to the store to try it on and although i knew the dress would fit i could not get the zipper up. my mom  the sales lady and i all tried to get the zipper up and it would not move past the ribbon. i wish i could have bought this dress but i can't without a working zipper. i tried a size up and every dress at the store that was my size and none of them worked. please fix the zipper problem so i can have this dress!,Dresses
-1,The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering  flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp  stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.  dear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to,Dresses
-1,I've been eyeing this dress for months  so when it went on sale i finally purchased it. now i see why it's on sale. the dress runs extremely large and has no shape.... looks like a potatoe sack and i feel like moo...moo in it! this will be going back to the store!!!!,Dresses
-1,"I have wanted this dress since i first tried it on in april. finally got it as a birthday gift and after looking at it closely there was makeup on the collar. i checked the instructions and it says ""cold water wash"". so i washed only the collar part by hand and every part that got water on it bled!!! looks like the popsicles are melting! i'm so sad because this dress is adorable! i'm buying another in hopes retailer will make this right by taking back the first one. should be dry clean only!",Dresses
-1,I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8  went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type  but compared to the model  this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.,Dresses
-1,I love the color patterns and fabric.  it has full lining!  my biggest problem with the dress is the swing style - makes it more like a maternity dress and so unflattering?  a straight (shift) style would have been much better.  dress runs large  however the arm/shoulder area is tight.,Dresses
-1,"Tried this dress in a small. i am 5'6""  135lbs  34c. the small was huge - the sash helped some  but looked like a potato sack on me. also  i noticed the fabric was piling slighly in the store. i had high hopes for this dress but left this one in the store.",Dresses
-1,While i thought it looked really pretty on the hanger  when i tried it on it just felt like a mess. perhaps it suits other personalities and bodies. i hated that the zipper was in the front; i personally find it tacky and gawdy. while the patterns are pretty  the material felt like some weird fabric wallpaper and i didn't see how the price was justified with how the material felt cheap to me.,Dresses
0,"I'm 5'6"" and it hits me at mid-thigh. the top (black/camel version) is sheer enough to need a cami. the waist is quite high. not flattering for me--the empire waist makes me look a bit pregnant--plus i don't want to deal with having to wear a cami.",Dresses
0,Beautiful dress; however  the top was small for my chest and the rest ran large.,Dresses
0,So despite reviewers saying this was too short i decided to try it anyways. the dress is adorable the print t g e pockets so cute but the description is incorrect. the petite falls 30 from shoulder which means it's right under your bum so you move anyway and someone gets a show. it's unfortunate because this dress is adorable. it would fit tts except length. unfortunately this one has to go back.,Dresses
0,I tried this on in the store - i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight. the material was a little itchy on me (but maybe its because the chest was tight). the color is lovely (pink). im sure someone will love it but if you are petite  i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty.,Dresses
0,The details on this dress were pretty  but it was super poofy and i felt like it made me look bigger than i am. maybe if you have a straight body and want to create curves this would work for that  but not great on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. fits tts.,Dresses
0,I tried this dress on in the store. it fit okay  but the orange is so bright  i couldn't bring myself to buy it.,Dresses
0,This dress is everything i hoped it would be--bright  colorful  quality jacquard  classic silhouette. unfortunately it runs small up top on the bust and i couldn't even zip it up all the way. returning :(,Dresses
0,The fit is really flattering and cute but the fabric and finishings seem really cheap. it's a printed plaid - not woven.,Dresses
0,I ordered this dress in two sizes  pxs and ps. they both arrived in a timely manner but the pxs was snagged upon arrival. there were a few other reviewers that stated the dress snagged easily but i loved the classic look of this dress so i thought i would take the chance. unfortunately i had to take both back to the store because the potential for snagging the fabric was too high even considering the sale price. also  the dress comes with a cotton slip but the slip for the pxs was tiny while the,Dresses

1,"I do love this dress. i wore it for my 20th anniversary party and received numerous compliments. it's great for embracing your curves. it has a wonderful ""vintage-made-modern"" flair that classic retailer pieces always have. you do have to be careful when wearing it...jewelry or belts may snag the intricate lacework. i am definitely the type of shopper who waits for a sale. this is one of the few pieces i felt i could splurge on. it is just that unique. i hope that retailer continues to carry these t",Dresses
1,"Absolutely lovely! even better in real life. this is not your typical cheap  flimsy dress. this is quality! the fabric is interesting  the color is gorgeous and the styling is flattering. pay attention to the length ? there are miles of fabric in that fortuny-esque skirt and the model is very tall. i am 5'5"" and slim  and ordered petite small  and it's a little longer on me than it is on the model. i don't mind. i've been looking for a special-occasion dress for a long time and knew this was it",Dresses
1,I tried this dress on today and ended up buying it. its a thicker material and looks better in person. more red and white striped with an uneven hem. the back of the dress is a bit more like a swim suit. i probably is best for smaller chests. i'm guessing it runs a little bit big - as the medium fit nicely on me and lately i'm a large medium/small large.,Dresses
1,Beautiful and different material  like it a lot. very happy with the purchase.,Dresses
1,This dress does run large  but i'm wearing it loose and flowy. bought it for desert trip music festival  with booties and a hat or headband  very hippie chic. my husband thinks it's adorable! the prints are darling.,Dresses
1,Super comfortable and cute!! i have received tons of compliments one this dress. the material is soft and the print/colors are awesome. this dress will get a lot of use over fall  winter and spring. runs a little big. i am typically a s but chose the xs . love love love!,Dresses
1,"What a fun print to have on a dress  let alone a sweet off white lace confection like this one. i really love the design and all the nice high quality touches. because i am busty and there is no stretch  i sized up. my only wish was that the look of the skirt wasn't so innocent..the flounce looks a bit juvenile  especially at my age. i'll try to figure out how to flatten it   maybe wet the skirts like a regency lady ;) here are my stats since i purchased 12p: 5'3"" 145# 36dd.",Dresses
1,Yay  i found it: my go-to dress for this summer! it's perfect for casual day-to-day stuff  as well as summer festivals  nights out  travel  etc. i love the design  length and fit. it's a bit snug in the chest area but i went with the smaller size as the shoulder straps sagged a bit in the larger size. the lace-up front gives it a sexy corset-type bodice  but in a very casual  appropriate way. i think this dress will work well with many body types and ages  it's flattering for us curvier ladies ,Dresses
-1,I ordered this in size xl in ivory. it was a drab  poorly-made  too-small sweater. the knit material wasn't good quality and the overall fit didn't work. i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock  then i would have overlooked the problems. but  there are better ivory retailer cardigans available. this was returned.,Fine gauge
-1,Based on the strength of the other reviews  i thought this sweater would be amazing  but i was disappointed. the knit is very thin  cheap looking and weak that it won't last a season undamaged. it reminds me of a duster i bought 15 years ago at a discount fast-fashion retailer when i was a student. sloppy looking with lots of creases out of the package. collar is odd and the sleeve openings have an annoying flare. the drape is not structured enough--everything about this screams over priced bath,Fine gauge
-1,"This sweater is a cute design but did not work for me. i am 5'9"" and this is way to short/cropped and looks awkward. the quality was so so  it looked stretched out in the front. it's getting returned.",Fine gauge
-1,This is not even a dolman style sweater because it's loose fitting everywhere around the arm. the point of a dolman sweater is that the sleeves are fitted around the wrist/forearm  but this is not the case with this sweater. it's super loose around the wrist area - i can fit both of my wrists into a sleeve.,Fine gauge
-1,I loved the style so i ordered on line. it runs small and the arm inserts are so low its awkward to wear. i wish the cut was better cause i love the look but not the fit. i am returning this item..,Fine gauge
-1,This sweater did not flatter a sz 12 with 36d chest. it's very well made but not for the curvy girl. this is my very first review and felt compelled to share my thoughts since i heavily rely on others' reviews before i purchase.,Fine gauge
-1,The fit was not flattering at all  but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos.,Fine gauge
-1,I ordered the orange in size xl. the fit on me matches the model other than being a little shorter in length.  the quality is bad. i ordered two of these sweaters and both arrived  new in the packages  with one having a small hole. the knit is so thin  as is the base material. the arms are basically see-through. it doesn't offer any warmth because of the thinness. i layered a long-sleeved white tee underneath which helped. the edge of the sleeves stretched out within an hour. i also had two area,Fine gauge
-1,The fit of this sweater did not flatter my body-type. the top half did not fit well; the armpit area was loose fitting and the neckline was awkward.,Fine gauge
0,This has a sparkle that you can't see in the pictures. i returned it. the design is cute but not worth the price.,Fine gauge
0,I ordered this in the pink color. the fit was fine  but i didn't care for how thin it was. there is lining  which i suppose is there to combat the thinness  but it's only in certain places. the lining should have been all over. maybe if i had gotten this in blue  it wouldn't have been so bad.,Fine gauge
0,Loved the look of this top. sadly it runs quite small and was very tight where other non-swing tops in a large do not. the item ran out of stock far too quickly. i normally wear a large but feared that the large would be small and wanted to order up but it was already put of stock. the quality and style are great especially for a larger chest. length is great for taller women.,Fine gauge
0,Looks great on the model  but if you're curvy it looks very frumpy.,Fine gauge
0,This sweater is much more cropped than shown. the sweater i received was only 24 inches long. the color of the trim is black  not the navy or plum that i expected. quality does seem good.,Fine gauge
0,Bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost. fabric feels cheap  like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly. did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack. gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag. returned it.,Fine gauge
0,Very pretty and has potential. only down side - i thought it was more like a cardigan with sleeves but it's really more of a shawl and the photos and descriptions are misleading,Fine gauge
0,This is a darling little sweater. it is well made and the fit is true to size  however  it's just not long enough on me to be a top  which is what i was hoping for.  i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of 40's style but it's way to short on me for that. even with my highest waisted pants and skirts  it shows skin.  i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something.  that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos.  i'm still,Fine gauge
0,I loved this at first....but the quality is awful! it pilled like crazy and started to get little holes near the neck after 4-5 wears. second sweater from retailer this year with severe pilling issues. i love retailer  but will never again buy another sweater here.,Fine gauge
1,This sweater is so much cuter in person than as pictured. i bought the lovely red one today. i got my usual size  xs. i plan to wear it more fitted as a top rather than as a jacket  although i can still layer it if i want. the color is divine. the weight is just right  not too heavy but not too light. sometimes peplums overwhelm me  but this one did not. it hits at just the right spots and is flattering all over  particularly making my waist look small.,Fine gauge
1,This sweater is super cute. it has nice weight to it and is just a nice casual but attractive piece to wear with jeans or white pants. love that it zips and just a really cute pattern of marigold  mint/teal and grey/dark gray.,Fine gauge
1,This is a lovely sweater--unique  nicely made  though i found that it ran large for me. i was between a size xs and small  and neither one seemed just right so i ended up returning it. the small had the right length in the arms and torso  but was too wide in the torso and shoulders  and the xs was too short. bummer! also found that every single ivory one had stains or spots on them in my local store  not sure why. if i had been able to settle on the right size i probably would've kept it!,Fine gauge
1,I bought the gray and it is so much prettier than it appears online. i agree with a previous post that it feels lighter but that works for me because i find wool terribly itchy and this sweater is not. i love it!,Fine gauge
1,This sweater is flattering  fun  and practical. i wear to work and out at night to dressier functions. i bought both the green and black. both are cute on and super soft.,Fine gauge

1,I just purchased this adorable  unique looking sweater at my local retailer store and absolutely love it. as soon as i saw it  i knew i had to have it! it is super soft  tts so i purchased it in my regular size small and it has the cutest pockets ever. the little black buttons also add to the look but the black snails on the pockets are what's really so sweet on this one. though i'm not a fan of snails in my garden  i'll make an exception for a couple of them making a guest appearance on this swea,Fine gauge
1,I have already worn this several times. it is very flattering  lightweight  and easy to wear. dressy but also very soft and comfortable.,Fine gauge
1,This sweater is beautiful and looks exactly as pictured in terms of fit  length  and color. the fabric is super soft and not at all itchy - feels soft like a boucle type knit. the sleeves are 3/4 length and the weight is maybe a medium-weight (not super warm). i wouldn't see this taking me too far into a northeastern winter  but for right now it's perfect!! fit is tts :),Fine gauge
-1,3 tags - one quite huge (about 2'' by 3'') - very itchy. so i cut out the tags and they are sewn with some kind of hard poky plasticy thread - now even more itchy! i will have to wear these inside out.,Intimates
-1,The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.,Intimates

-1,3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,Intimates
-1,Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.,Intimates
0,I'm a 32-a  and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight  but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back  it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it  but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.  the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work  because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.,Intimates

0,"The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical.",Intimates
0,I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn't even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color  it's really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out.,Intimates
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
0,When ordering this product  i thought it was strange that the mediums were sold out. i went with the small which is generally what i wear. however  these run small and i see why the medium ran out. they are pretty  however  i wish they made them more true to size.,Intimates

1,This piece fits true to size and is very flattering on. sometimes i worry about my stomach not being perfectly flat  but this wasn't an issue at all  probably because of the intricate lace details. the fabric is substantial enough that i don't feel like it'll get a hole in it after multiple wears.,Intimates
1,"This is beautiful and fits perfect. it's even prettier in person  and extremely comfortable and high quality. i'm 5'3"" and it hits right above the knee. the straps are adjustable and fits true to size. i bought an xs and it fits perfect. must buy for a sweet little night gown!",Intimates
1,My bridesmaids gifted this to me at my bridal shower  and of all the lingerie i received that day  this was the most memorable. it is equally romantic and sexy as it is subtly sheer. the delicate eyelash lace detail adds so much flair. i have this in size small and it fits tts. love this piece! i plan to wear this for my boudoir shoot.,Intimates
1,Oh how i love this bra!! its so comfortable and very flattering. i find that many bralettes totally flatten me out but this one does not. and the floral lace here is just beautiful. the daisy-type flowers look so cute and feminine! i've got it in so many colors now. for sizing  i'm 34b and the s/m fits great.,Intimates
-1,I have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer  which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer. however  the quality is very poor - it feels like it might fall apart after one clean. also  the buttons where not sewn on properly. i wear an xs and the size was a good fit  but the overall quality was not worth the price (or even close to it).,Jackets
-1,I really loved this vest online and decided to try it on in store. it was really cute on and fit nicely so i purchased it (in my normal size) and took it on a vacation. first time wearing it and the color transferred all over my white shirt even though it says it is pre-washed. i am very disappointed considering how expensive this was. overall  it is very cute but it may ruin your clothes so beware!,Jackets
-1,I was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isn't my first choice. that was the least of the problems with this jacket. i love sparkle  and i love beautiful detail  none of the elements by themselves was a problem. the sum of the parts didn't work  though. the end result was an unflattering  confusing mess. the silhouette plus the frayed edges  plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast  plus the zipper were just too many things to go t,Jackets
-1,I wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo  but i guess my frame was still to petite. the fabric was also on the cheap end,Jackets
-1,I generally don't write bad reviews  but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great  but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin  so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time  and this is not a $98 item of clothing.,Jackets
-1,Love retailer's kimonos and when i saw this pattern i had to have it! unfortunately  when i bought it the tag was already showing holes so they gave me 15% off... went to wear it for the first time  there was already a huge snag in it! i love retailer but for 98$ this is not worth your money.,Jackets
-1,1. i like a shorter jacket  but this one was poorly made and poorly fit.  2. the sleeves were way too tight. i'm a size 10 or 12  and the large which would be a 14 had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms  and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out.  3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14)   and neither hung right. the m too tight  and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.  4. very polyester with lots of static.  5. cute idea  but not very good in pe,Jackets
-1,Love the jacket! so versatile! would probably order up a size if you like a loose fit.,Jackets
-1,Beautiful fabric! unfortunately  i had to return it. after just one wear  it had pills all over the side. fabric is too delicate. sad to return!,Jackets
0,Beautiful sweater coat! love that is easy to pop on & head out. i did have to go to a seamstress and have the button moved as it was to large and boxy around my waist area.,Jackets
0,This blazer is a nice weight for summer. it is more terracotta than rose  but is still a nice color. the fit is tts and flattering. however  the buttons were almost falling off the one i received. i didn't take this as a sign of great quality and plan to return it.,Jackets
0,I was excited to see this offered by retailer because i have been looking for a light blue summer jacket or blazer that isn't a denim jacket and this seemed to fit the bill. i've ordered several cartonnier blazers in 00p  as early as 2013 and as late as spring 2015  and have been very happy with them. on the plus side i would say that the color is depicted accurately and it does seem like a high quality jacket. but while the shoulders and sleeves were a pretty standard fit for 00p  it was much too,Jackets
0,Delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness. loved the unmatched buttons  checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy. easyily dress it up or down  that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight. i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build. ordered a 4 but i think a 6 would have been perfect!,Jackets
0,This jacket is cozy  warm  and very cute  but after the 1st washing (according to the manufacturer's instructions) it began to pill and has worsened each time.,Jackets
0,Very cute coat but could not keep it for the price...just not sure it is worth almost $200 00 (with tax added to cost). when it goes on sale  i will most likely buy it.,Jackets
0,When i tried it on it looked like a stiff bathrobe. straight  too boxy.,Jackets
0,Looks so cute in the picture  but just didn't really look that flattering on - plus the sleeves were too tight and too long for my short arms so going back....,Jackets
0,The fabric is beautiful  even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large  as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure  even though it's a lapel  and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs  and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad  as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time.,Jackets
1,This is a wonderful vest! i love the lining!! keeps you nice and warm! i love the muted green color! the pockets are sewn closed but can be cut open at the stitching without ruining the vest!!,Jackets
1,I am a lover of jackets and coats; this is my new fave!   great color  versatile (i.e. work  weekend). fun accent piece to shield yourself from a brisk wind  while maintaining full fashion status.   my first day wearing and i've rec'd many compliments. love the combo of trench coat and poncho. my one issue...i wish the sleeve strap actually buckled  it keeps slipping out of the faux buckle and i'm afraid i'm going to lose it. i usually wear a medium/size 10  but medium was sold out  so i ordered,Jackets
1,I bought the blazer in the grey motif color. it is definitely a taupe color versus grey but it does look as pictured.i bought a small after trying it on in store. i think it runs a bit small as i mostly wear xs at retailer. the arms are very fitted in my opinion  so if you have bigger arms  it might feel too snug. you don't really see this detail in the picture but the lapel folds differently on each side  meaning one folds back higher than the other  so it isn't a symmetrical look. i actually lik,Jackets
1,I love this jacket. the color is what drew me to it and it looks just like the picture. as far as sizing goes  i'm usually a medium but i ordered a small and it fit well. i feel that if i had ordered a medium it would look a little too puffy for my taste. the small gives me a more fitted look.,Jackets
1,I love this vest and could not leave without it. the color and lining just make it perfect  so stylish and comfy! i'm always a 8/10 and a m in this was perfect. the color is so beautiful and its so easy to dress up and down. i am big on the bottom  the tie in the back adds a nice shape to your whole profile and makes it a less boxy vest! love love...,Jackets
1,I at first only intended to try this jacket on and get a feel for the fit and style  as i've been looking for spring/fall in-between weather outerwear. but i unexpectedly (and maybe unfortunately for my bank account) fell in love instantly. the fabric is very soft  and the cut is cute  stylish  and flattering. the quality seems good  and the fit is perfect. i ordered an xs regular in the moss color.,Jackets
1,"What a great little find. it is so soft  and the color blends with everything. a great way to get a few more weeks out of your summer sleeveless dresses  and ease into fall. great with t shirts and pants as well.the collar is flattering over any neckline. it also looks great as a shirt. it really can be worn all year round. i usually wear a size six on top  as ""my girls"" are large. the medium was a perfect fit. and there was no billowing in the back. worth the price  as it will become a go to ja",Jackets
1,I love layering this over basic tees (or graphic ones like the wild west tee) - it adds just the right amount of edge. currently building my pin collection to add on (vintage turquoise and rock music to be exact).,Jackets
1,Love this sweater/jacket. fit is good and the colors are just right  not to bright and not boring. the shawl color takes a wee bit of adjusting but is worth the extra minute or so. also has a hood built into shawl that when not in use can not be seen  very cool. have worn it a couple of times and always get compliments.,Jackets
-1,I was extremely excited to receive these pants  given the two positive reviews. i'm a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions. i sized down from my normal size (27 to a 26) and was swimming in these pants. i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work. i'm not sure if i received a defective pair or what  but be cautious ordering these pants.,Jeans
-1,I loved these pants the minute i put them on  and was so happy i'd ordered them. but i wore them only 3 times - and only at dinners with friends  not even for full days - and the seams on both legs ripped open! i think the faux leather just isn't equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings. i was super-bummed about this  because these pants are so insanely cute. but if they can't hold up to a few casual wears  then there's just no way... thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom,Jeans
-1,"I wanted to love these jeans  but as a woman who is almost 45 there was way too much stretch in them. i am always a size 26 and i couldn't wear these  they were way too tight! they went back the next day. i will say  it could be my body type  i""m a runner so my legs are muscular. if you have very thin legs  these could be great and work for you. i loved the color  dark blue.",Jeans
-1,I've purchased pilcro jeans in the past and they've held up great. unfortunately  the material used for this particular jean is a far  far cry from what it used to be. the thighs of these jeans start pilling (yes pilling!) after just a few wears. i've never had jeans do this -- whatever denim blend they are using is a complete disaster.    don't buy these -- you will be very disappointed.,Jeans
-1,I generally don't spend this much on jeans but wanted a nice black pair so rolled the dice during the sale. who can wear these? i'm an average size 12 and struggled to get these size 32s over my hips  buttoned and zipped. i looked like a stuffed black sausage. best for thin frames and even then  size up.,Jeans
-1,I have other stevies  and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist  approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally  the cuff is sewn like that in place  and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like  a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!,Jeans
-1,I purchased these in january and today i am going back to retailer to request a refund; the fabric on the inner thighs are absolutely thread bare. i am 5'6 and wear a size 28. they fit comfortably with great stretch  but apparently the fabric is so cheap that if your thighs should happen to touch  you will wear holes through the thighs in very short order.    first they started piling  which i had never a pair of pilcro pants do before  and within 2 washes i could actually see through the f,Jeans

0,The fit on these is good for my hourglass shape  and the fabric quality and comfort is good too.i think the rinse is just not as nice in person- the orange stitching is pretty bright too. i bought. a pair from br a couple months ago that are almost identical in quality  fit and color that i got for less than half the price of these. i am going to return these and see if they have something better   but will only buy in store from now on.,Jeans
0,I agree with the other reviews that these jeans run big. for my body  straight up and down  i ordered 2 sizes down  but would have ordered one size down had i been able to try them on in the store. the jeans i received were lighter  not blue  and more grey with very noticeable white whiskering. i need a new pair of jearns and i love the cut of these so i am keeping this pair  but  for me  because of the color they are just ok compared to the wow i was expecting from the picture.,Jeans
0,I thought these would be nice  and they are but then i started thinking that the bejewels will eventually be out of style and these can't be as much of a classic... also  the jewels make the jeans feel heavier.   fit is like most boyfriend/girlfriend jeans  slightly loose (not as much on me due to muscles) and length on petite was close to what is shown here (typical for me that it is still a bit longer  as not only am i short  but i have short legs for my shortness!)    so if you want that styl,Jeans
0,"I have other pairs of stevie jeans and looked forward to receiving these.i would say that they run about a size large compared to my other pairs. i am 5'2"" and ordered a petite  but i found the length to be about 2-3 inches too long. as compared to how they look on the model. also  the rise is relatively low. otherwise  the quality is great  and the denim is very soft. i will probably return these given that i am not wowed.",Jeans
0,I am a pretty consistent size 2 or 26. ordered these in my usual 26 and  yikes  right out of the package knew they''d be way to small. they have a lot of stretch in them so i was able to get them buttoned but they were wayyyy too small and looked awful. i returned them for a 27 which i am still waiting for. i'll update this review when they arrive. other than the size issue  they were just as pictured/expected.,Jeans

0,"The tag on the jeans said ""won't stretch out""  and i've already returned one pair to size down when they stretched out by the end of the first wear. ive been wearing the smaller size for a week  and it's stretching out as well. the crotch ends up dropping two or 3 inches and i keep having to hike the pants up in public  after just a week of owning them. i love paige jeans  and the cut and color of these are amazing. i'm going to have to size down one last time just to get them to stay up  i hope",Jeans
1,Bought these jeans after reading others reviews and was not disapointed. these are the most flatering jeans! they give you legs for days  while providing amazing shape. oh and did i mention their soft as butter. huge win for me as jeans are one of the most difficult items for me to my as my waist is 1-2 sized smaller than my hips and thes stretch marvilously to fit your body. they are on the pricier side and well worth it.,Jeans
1,I'm giving these leggings 5 stars although i did return them. first off i do love pilcro jeans and leggings. beware these are not jeans at all. the tag says serif legging. these are excellent leggings if that's what you're looking for. i thought they were jeans and was willing to spend the money on them  but not for leggings. i'll consider buying if they go on sale.,Jeans
1,I got them in green and the color is very nice. the waist is a little higher than the ag cords  but that only makes them comfortable and holds the tummy in a little good length and the pant holds up nice thru out the day  no sagging yet in the knee and behind area,Jeans
1,"These jeans are so cute! they are perfect for petites too! i am fit  look way younger than my age and get so many compliments when i wear these jeans. i'm. i'm 5'2""  115 libs and they definitely fit tight in a good way. just like the photo pretty much. they are not small like the white mother ankle fray jeans for sale on the site now. those definitely run smaller so these are true to size with a tight fit.",Jeans
1,"Love these pants. love the fit. i can't wait to wear them  but i have to find the time to hem them first. i am kinda tall at 5'9"" and i wear a lot of heels  even tall heels. but these pants are even too long for my 3-4"" heels  and i don't wear taller than that to work every day. only on very rare occasions. so they do need to be hemmed. they are a great cream white color so can carry on through the winter and will also get a lot of use in the spring and summer. good fabric and a nice fit!",Jeans
1,I love these jeans. they are very comfortable and do not stretch excessively after wear. i found the cut to be very flattering and the material to be heavy enough to hold its shape while still having enough give to move around and chase after little ones. they look great paired with a v-neck and flats or cute blouses and heels. a great buy! like another reviewer i  too  found these ran a little small and went up a size.,Jeans
1,Great pants! i love the style and fit! would highly recommend!,Jeans
1,I'm not nearly as tall as the model so these hit right just right for flats. i love the fit of the wide leg and found the color matching the photo and the light color cords very soft. i did try the blue color on at a different store and found them a bit short. i'm really pleased with these and the sale on sale certainly helped.,Jeans
1,Expected them to fit somewhat loose but actually tight for a boyfriend fit. like a slightly relaxed skinny with a really low crotch. stretches everywhere when sitting and walking except the waistband. the distressing and fraying holes in good placement. wish there was some on the back of the leg but i have yet to find a pair that does that. good color and quality  but not quite worth full price. will probably look for them on sale later. i always prefer skinny jeans over boyfriend do it might bi,Jeans

-1,The shirt is very soft but it felt very large and unflattering. the back felt bulky and looked awkward. definitely returning.,Knits

0,The fit is a bit loose in the body (more than you can tell on the model) - more like a true swing style top. i feel the arms are a good fit  but i ordered one size up from my normal since i'm planning to wear this as a maternity top. arms are definitely a size smaller than the body. the ruffles at the bottom are a bit odd  but overall i still like it. the cutout notch at the collar is super cute! plus  the green color of this top is lovely and i love that it's made in the usa so i'll be keeping,Knits

0,I don't know what the problem with this sweater was on me but it just didn't work. it was too wide across the breastline  i think  creating a boxy shape that just didn't look flattering. outside of that  the sweater was lightweight and seemed well made. i was sad to send it back  especially at the sale price.,Knits

1,If you like a slightly heavier  non/clingy basic tee  this is it. i wore the long sleeved version all fall and winter  rotating colors  and i've been wearing these with shorts and leggings since i got them. the colors are great  fabric is quality  and the ribbon detail in the back gives these a little flare.,Knits
1,This is a bit pricey  but i think the akemi and kin quality is worth the price. this photo is quite inadequate to let you see the gorgeous dye color and floral detail. the sleeves are upturned and tacked; the curvy hem is very flattering  and the designer added a small triangle of cloth at the top of the curvy side  just to add to the careful  custom detail. the 60% cotton/40% modal is deliciously soft. the fine detail in cut  fit  artistic design will make this not simple tee a divine pleasure,Knits
1,This is a great top and it fit me very nicely but it's much longer than it appear to be in the picture. i'm 5'2 and it was more like a tunic than a tank on me. if it were shorter it would be one of my favorite staples i'm sure. if you're very tall i think you will love it.,Knits
1,Love this top. it's very comfortable   and flatters  my midsection. versatile piece.,Knits
1,This is a great swingy tank for summer and the smocking adds a nice design element to an otherwise plain white top. i typically wear a l  sometimes xl in tops from retailer  but the l in this is pretty loose - i am hoping it will shrink down quite a bit in the wash. otherwise i really love the top  and now that it's on sale  the price is definitely right! i wish the black one was still available!,Knits
1,I tried this on at antho today and loved it! the pictures online are not doing this garment any favors. it is flattering in person. the fabric is a light fabric-i was a little disappointed in this since i like things to be a little warmer  but this is probably better anyway with spring coming (it is coming  right?-today it's snowing) i like the under-layer that is kind of silky which i think adds a special touch to it. it is versatile and could be paired with anything.,Knits

0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering
0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering

1,I saw the tank at the store and was so glad to try it on. i got the small?i'm in between xs and s (34b) and try to get petites when i can but the small fit great with a longer cut. i bought the green and did not find it sheer. i actually thought it was thicker than most tanks and tees these days. i found the arm holes were fine. i usually need to go with a petite just for this reason but no need to this time. planning on getting a couple of more colors!,Layering
1,This top is well made and the pleats give it a whimsical feel. i'm still debating on keeping it as it's slight boxy.,Layering
1,I usually wear a medium or large in retailer clothes. i purchased this in a large and it fit perfectly. it is a clingier top but i didn't find it too much so. the ribbing makes it very attractive and slimming  and also can be worn as a stand alone turtleneck or easily as a layered piece. it is super soft and comfy as others have mentioned  and a tad thicker than just a cotton turtleneck would be - it has substance. also  it would be great for traveling because it doesn't wrinkle at all. love that!,Layering
1,"The lace detail adds a nice spin to an otherwise plain tank. looks great under a cardi  jacket  sweater coat... for the most part it fits true to size. it's not as fitted as i hope it would be. at 5'1""  115lbs  i got my usual xsp. my biggest gripe is the very deep v-neck--its shows my bra. eek. it's like the strap could be shortened to help remedy it but then it may leave the arm hole too small or bring it too high up. perhaps it may shrink in the wash or i just need to get bigger boobs. maybe t",Layering

0,I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum  but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through  so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top  they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer  but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately  these fall in the latter category.,Lounge

-1,These were so perfect for the first hour or so. i was convinced they were my new favorite pants! but their initial forgiveness turned into a slovenly stretch  and they creased and wrinkled like crazy after i'd been sitting a couple hours. it looked downright embarrassing - saggy and wrinkly (radiating from the crotch  no less) . i got them in the gray  and it's possible that other colors use different  less awful fabric.,Pants
-1,I read the cleaning instructions label carefully. followed them closely. and still  the dye ran and stained some of my colored clothes. pi**ed me off! just after the first wash and even before wearing them  i have streaks of uneven color on the pants. bad quality material or dye is what causes this. now i have to go and see if i can even get out my other stained clothes. thanks a lot retailer.,Pants
-1,I was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person. the fabric is a rough gauzy texture. the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something  they do not hang or move well on the body. also  they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off. sadly  these are going back.,Pants

0,I ordered this pants in white and black. i read the reviews and weren't that bad. i am 5'6 and 125 lbs. i got them in size small. they are way too big. the small size seems to be xl and they are way too long for someone who is maybe 5'8 or 5'9. i have to returned them. quality is ok looking on my opinion.,Pants
0,I purchased these pants in blue  they fit great - only problem is that one leg is about 1/2 inch longer than the other. i got them on sale with a discount so i will keep them and take them to a tailor to fix. bummer.,Pants
0,I want to like and keep. at this price point i cant justify keeping. if it does go to clearance i will reorder. due to the thin material it seems more summery and casual than what i was anticipating. true to size. i ordered a medium and am 5'9 and 155 pounds.,Pants
0,These ran very small compared to other charlie pants i've bought in the past. even sizing up  the stripes were not flattering. the lady in the next dressing room over tried them on  too  and had the same feeling i did. the less curvy you are  the better stripes look. they more curvy you are  the less flattering stripes on pants look. the way the stripes come together at the seams just isn't flattering.,Pants

0,About a month ago i purchased the pilcro hypen chinos in moss size 28 petite. i loved the color and fit so much that when i saw free shipping being offered i decided to get another pair. this time i ordered the color ?pink? and of course size 28 petite. well the color really isn?t pink and unlike the moss color it does not look the color online. the color is more like salmon or apricot definitely not pink. what bothered me more is the fit. this pair was too big. it?s mind-boggling why the sizing,Pants
0,Love pilcro  love the stripes and the length - but this particular pair of capris/crops are super tight fitting. i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight. i guess its just the cut/fabric combo. i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel ...... may work for you  however!,Pants

1,I know you cannot tell from the pictures  but the fabric on this is incredible. it is very light and extremely airy so that it flows when you walk. i am a rather petite individual so it would require excessive tailoring for me to wear this-both in length and in the top. i think it was true to size with this exception-and i wish they offered this in petite. i would have tailored the length if it was only that  but on the top (i am not large-chested) there was a bunch of extra fabric that just lai,Pants
1,I love the way these pants feel on. they are so comfortable and breezy. i love that i can feel cool in the summer without showing a lot of skin. i purchased both colors; both are very nice looking. that said  i'm not sure if i will keep them. they wrinkle something terrible. i'm pretty casual person and it even bothers me. it probably wouldn't be so bad if there weren't pleats in the front. after sitting for just a few minutes the pants look like a disaster in front. my husband said it's not ext,Pants
1,These pants are simply darling! i purchased them with my birthday discount (thank you  retailer!) and even without a discount i think they are worth every penny. flattering  and the most important feature of any pant  makes my butt look good. don't hesitate  buy these today before they are out of stock.     the fit is true to size and the material is of excellent quality.,Pants
1,I promised myself only one pair of joggers this year  and these were the ones i went with (in the blue motif). for me the tipping point was the quality and fit of these were far superior than the others i tried  while still being machine washable. the fabric has aa little substance  yet is still lightweight and comfortable. the fit has a perfect bit of tailoring/tapering to be ultra-flattering while having the comfort of pajama pants. the blue motif is adorable too - love the geometric shapes. l,Pants
1,These were not tts  imo. i am a 10 and ordered the m. they did not look bad  but b/c these have no stretch  they were not comfy  like joggers are supposed to be. i ordered the lg when they went on sale and while they are baggy  the comfort is spot on in the larger size. i got the navy after seeing the irl pics. happy with this sale purchase !,Pants
1,My experience with these have been great and the colors are even more beautiful in person! they're easy to dress up for work and going out and easy to dress down for hanging out on the weekends. i am typically a size 31-32 and 30's fit me like a glove. i also typically wear petite but don't like the just-above-the-ankle cut of these so i purchased them in regular and wear them as pants. i can un-cuff them with heals/wedges or keep the double cuff and they hit me perfectly as full-length pants wi,Pants

-1,Looked really cute on the hanger  so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft  and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it.,Shorts
-1,The picture makes the shorts look structured. i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material. i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester.     also  this runs way too big. i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs.    i wouldn't even buy this at the sale price.,Shorts
-1,I've been wearing these shorts for years  i work outside and it was great to have comfortable jean shorts that were just the perfect length. the fabric quality on these shorts (and many many other retailer items) has gone down. sure  they're great when you try them on in the store..soft  comfortable  flattering  but when these are worn for a day they get so stretched out that i feel like i need a belt to keep them on. i wore these several times  sat down on a relatively smooth concrete wall  and a,Shorts
-1,I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined  i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined  you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and  comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.,Shorts

0,Fabulous fabric  adorable details. fitting is very  very odd. it's non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose  but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over  the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i'd get a larger size  but then i can't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall ,Shorts
0,I know rompers typically aren&amp;#39;t the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper  etc. and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on. the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i don&amp;#39;t think it is worth the price.,Shorts

1,Very cute skort that fits tts. great length for us middle aged women as well! love the hidden front pockets and the modern color block design. my only issue is the side zipper gets stuck right where the waistband starts. i'm assuming this is because of the thicker fabric around the waistband. i usually try to wait for the sale prices  but i think this skort will sell out well before then.,Shorts
1,I never buy shorter shorts  my legs are so muscular that most are unflattering  but these were actually ok. they didn't look loose like the model  but hit a nice spot on the leg  and they have enough stretch to fit me nicely. i even bought the white color... unheard of! i weigh 115 lbs  all legs...,Shorts
1,Tried these on several times in store and never bought them  but was able to get them with a 20% email- seemed like a better price for the product. the color is rust and a little odd for my wardrobe - wish they also came in black. love the style and they are very comfortable  perfect for late summer- can wear on errands or dress them up a little with shoes/accessories for casual dinner out. happy i finally purchased them!,Shorts

1,I followed the advice of the other reviewer and went 2 sizes up  i'm so glad that i did. i'm usually an 8 and i ordered a 12 and they are just right. the pleats made them very flowy in the hip  so it gives a little wider look on me than i really want  but i really love these shorts  so it's not a deal breaker. overall  i am happy with them  but definitely size up!,Shorts
-1,This skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i've ever ordered from retailer. it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving. it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all. there are also weird stitching lines. one more thing that i didn't like about the skirt was that it's a cream-ish color. not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt. it's going back.,Skirts

-1,This skirt is definitely not what i was expecting. the material is stiff and rough. the skirt is also loud. you can hear it swishing when you move  and not in a classy way. it feels like you're wearing a very long tutu. also  the pattern isn't quite as pretty in person. they must have used magic in order to make this skirt look flowy in the photos - it does not flow.,Skirts

0,I really like this skirt but unfortunately there is no lining  so it's a bit see through under the light. also there is no hook at the top of the zipper to secure the skirt. i just think that with this kind of price  the skirt should come at least with the lining. otherwise  it's beautiful skirt  flowy and very feminine.,Skirts

1,First mermaid-ish skirt ever that's flattering enough to pull off with a curvy lower body. the material is light-weight sweater knit that hugs in all the right places and its unique cut along the bottom make it very in the moment. the color is a rich  deep  gorgeous brown with subtle highlights that draw from whatever top you pear with it. runs large so size down.,Skirts
1,I ordered a size 6 and an 8 based on the review that said that the piece ran small. i fit both skirts but chose the size 8 as it was a bit looser at the hip and the length was better. funny though-the pockets on both skirts were sewn at very uneven areas on both. neither skirt had usable pockets as they were sewn shut at half inch intervals on one skirt (6)  and very uneven intervals on the other (8). i liked the idea of pockets which is one reason i ordered it-it is described as having side poc,Skirts
1,But the back of it  by the waist  bunches just a tiny bit. if i get bigger  it will be too long. but i love the skirt  it is flattering and cute. not itchy for me even if the title says wool. i ordered the 00p and the length is pretty much as pictured  just below the knee in front. the waist is snug  bigger it would fall more on my hips (hence the too long comment earlier.
