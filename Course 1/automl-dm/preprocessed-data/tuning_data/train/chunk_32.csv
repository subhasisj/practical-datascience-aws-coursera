0,Unfortunately this dress ran very large on me (please no more vanity sizing!) and minimized what few curves i have. my store didn't have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist. it also flares out quite a bit  you can see this in the catalog shot. while this wasn't flattering on me  it may work better on curvier figures.
-1,I generally don't write bad reviews  but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great  but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin  so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time  and this is not a $98 item of clothing.
0,Gorgeous color! salmon not pink though! lovely soft drape fabric but the itty bity thread and hook in the center is awful! i am a size 2/4 d cup and ordered a small and the closure is not adequate at all! it looks terrible closed and is too revealing without a cami underneath. does not fit like the model!
-1,"I ordered this in a small and medium hoping one would work  but the previous reviews were exactly correct  the bodice is way too small in proportion to the rest of the jumpsuit. the bottom has lots of fabric  which wouldn't be bad except you have to go up a size to make the bodice fit  then the bottom becomes overwhelming. i am 5'5"" and 115 so i have a slim build and couldn't get the bodice to zip in a small. the medium would have needed altering  which wouldn't have fixed the extra fabric on th"
1,This sweater looks just as pictured on the model. its very warm though even with cropped sleeves. i ordered a large and it was true to size but roomy. i liked this top very much but is thicker than seems. outer grey material isn't very pleasant & itchy  however the bottom portion is an underneath gown and attached to sleeves inside so its very soft on touch.
1,I just received this jacket in the cream color. it is so cute! you can change it from 3/4 to full length sleeves. i ordered both an xs and s and kept the s after i saw that i could cinch the waist to fit better. in the picture it looks a bit boxier than it really is possibly because not cinched. the material is good quality and the jacket is complete with attention to detail from the buttons to the jean contrast pull on the zipper. i love this jacket! it is a good cross over from athletic to cas
1,This dress is so pretty!! the second i saw it i knew i had to have it. make sure to get a smaller size because it can be a little big towards the waist as a result of the dress' design.
0,Really wanted to love dress but something was off with fit. fabric is lovely and zipper detail nice unfortunately style was not for me.
0,"I love this dress  i mean it si really pretty in person  however  the breast area is just too small... i can't wear a bra with it  and my ""older"" breasts just droop  not flattering. they are barely covered... i am a bit disappointed at that  but if you are smaller up there  i say give it a try... i am 115 lbs  26.5 ion waist  30dd and xs petite was great everywhere but chest.    colors and fabric are great  i love that the different colors are different types of fabric... too bad."
-1,"When i saw this online i immediately put it on my ""must buy"" list. i hate paying the exorbitant shipping fees retailer charges so i was waiting until i could get to my local store  in the meantime it looks like it has sold out online but i am sure it will be back in stock soon. luckily  my b&m store had it and i am so glad i didn't waste my money or time ordering it online. this could have been great but once again antho missed the mark. what the product shot online doesn't show is that it has dol"
0,Doesn't fit as tight/as slimming as you think it would by looking at the picture  definitely order one size down if you want it to fit tight!
-1,I wanted these culottes to work so much! the fabric is gorgeous  but the size i ordered didn't fit. i'm normally a size 28 in pants  and i ordered a size 8. it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area. not what i wanted it to be. had to return them unfortunately.
-1,Adorable foxes  i was smitten in the store but the fix is bizarre and the foxes don't come up very high so you're limited in the length you can wear. i bought the m/l based on salesperson advice and i can't imagine trying anything smaller  i usually wear a size s or 4 bottom  these were super snug. back to the store they went.
0,"Like the other reviewers  i agree that this sweater is waaaay shorter than it looks on the model. i think she's wearing a large size and it's probably cinched in the back. still cute  though! i'm 5'9"" 145 and a medium fits well -- looks cute with high-waisted jeans (which i wear anyway)."
1,I saw this shirt in store a while ago  but could not believe the price and was not about to spend my money on it. however  when it went on sale and there was an extra 40%  i decided to get it. i like the top  it's cute and fun. however  it does poof out a little in the midline. this top goes great with jeans or shorts  and it is cute  but definitely not worth full price for this.
0,Beautiful detail and soft sweater. i ordered a medium and the toro so fit well but was short. arms were long and baggy in comparison. given the fit  i didn't think the small would work. really wanted this to work but unfortunately it is going back.
-1,Seemed pretty shapeless which surprised me because of the design. perhaps it was just too big. returned it.
0,I bought this thinking it would be a great summer tunic  but it was really huge on me. i normally wear a medium but ordered down a size and it was still quite large. it was very long as well and i am 6' tall. i am normally a size 8  to give you an idea. i would recommend it  but it is going back for me.
0,This is a very sweet/soft sweater  however it runs very large and is very boxy! i would say at least size down 1-2 sizes! i wanted to love them but i had to send it back!!
1,I really love this sweater. i normally wear an 8 and bought a 12. even it is a little snug. but it really is very cute! can't wait to wear it with black leggings and boots.
-1,I'm petite  but even if i weren't  i think this runs very large  isn't form flattering at all  and overall looks dull. it most definitely does not justify the price. material is thin.
-1,I ordered this online  and took it back the day i got it. i could not fit the neck hole over my head  therefore i couldn't even see how it truly fit. i had high hopes for this dress.
1,This top is very cute. but the middle seam in off center near the bottom and cause the top to twist while wearing it. that is annoying.
1,As the previous reviewer mentioned  this dress is great for a dress that doesn't have a true waist. it really fits awesome. so incredibly soft  high quality material  and the mesh pockets are perfection (pockets that are so small/light that you can't tell the dress even had them when looking at it!). the color of the dress is what initially drew me to it (definitely a different color for a sun dress) and after trying it on in stores i would say 'beware.' though it truly is a rich and different c
0,I wanted to love this dress  and thought it would be perfect for a barn wedding i have coming up. it was allllllmost right but sadly fell short. the bib that hangs over the bust hits in a really unflattering mid point that makes you look wide. nipple tassels effect. plus i would feel the urge to keep pulling it down. did notice some of the puckering others mentioned but didn't bother me  however  the way the lining and the dress line up at the bottom did. so close  so sad
1,Really cute romper that can be dressed up or down. super comfortable and flattering. i ordered the xs and it fit perfect.
-1,I wanted to love this shirt. the fit was a little off and i wish it had come in a little at the waist to be more figure flattering before it flared out. the fabric is nice but wrinkles easily and in the white is see through.. sadly i will be returning.
1,While this top does fit very loose  it is very cute and can be relaxed or you can dress it up. it is shorter in the front and longer in the back which makes the shirt take on a flattering look. i bought the green color and it is a very rich color  it will be perfect for fall! you may consider ordering a size down if your regular size tends to fit loose.
0,Sooo this adorable blouse is indeed different than pictured. no ruffle  such a bummer  sleeves are much longer  and yes it's teared in the front and back. also the button opening on the back is much longer/larger  in my opinion. i'll most likely keep it  but consider the mentioned if buying.
1,Absolutely love this top! i've been on the lookout for a cute cotton top  something that'd be ideal for summertime. this beautiful piece doesn't disappoint. the color pairing - white cotton base and lovely red thread embroidery - looks stunning. not the mention the unique back detailing makes it a must-have. highly recommend.
-1,I had such high hopes for this blouse  as it looks totally stunning online. however  it's not as pictured/described in that it is totally sheer and the brand is not floreat  but rather hd in paris. for the price  the quality is just not there...i've seen comparable shirts at other stores for much less. i returned it without a second thought.
-1,I fell in love with this cute top  however after reading reviews  i am going to return it. seems there is a problem with it shrinking after following washing instructions. who wants to dry clean a tank top? not me  sadly. too bad. style was cute and color was awesome.
-1,I am now the third person to try this dress and return it for the same reason. the empire waist is too high and hits across the bust instead of underneath it. i can't imagine how they got it to fit this model so well. i am petite and i really love the idea of a maxi with sleeves  so i decided to try it even through the two previous reviewers reported this issue. unfortunately  i had the same problem. i am a c+ cup size. perhaps this would work on a very thin figure with a small bust. i ordered t
1,"I ordered this skirt in my usual xs. when it arrived it looked tiny. the xs was almost impossible to get on. i ended up returning the xs for a medium  which fit perfectly (and is work appropriate). my measurements are 5'6"" and 125. my recommendation would size up two sizes."
0,I ordered this in tan and white  but ended up returning it. the material is a bit thin (but soft). the shape of the top was decent  i didn't think it was too boxy but i didn't like how the seams looked on the sides. ultimately i didn't think it was worth the price.
0,The top is huge! i wear an xs and am not the bustiest of women  but the top part of this romper felt like it belonged on a medium or large  even though the bottoms and waist fit perfectly. i was really disappointed  as i loved it in every other way.
-1,The color is completely off! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment. it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture. very pale. horrible.
0,First  the good: i like the basic shape of the jacket  with its crisply cut lapels  and rounded corners at the bottom...the functional pockets (including the  cool watch pocket)  the size of the buttons  the color. i got the honey   and it was lovely and intense . now  the bad:  i got the regular 8. the jacket is at least an inch too short. although it's  a small  tight 8  the sleeves are strikingly too long. they would have to  be folded  and the lining which would show is not that attractive.
0,I am ever in search of a light  white  summer top. this is not quite it. there are two distinct layers  and each of them is the scratchy  starchy type of gauze. it would just roast me in the summer sun--but i run fairly hot in general.
1,I love this top so much! the fit is super flattering and forgiving in the tummy area-win.
-1,I generally don't spend this much on jeans but wanted a nice black pair so rolled the dice during the sale. who can wear these? i'm an average size 12 and struggled to get these size 32s over my hips  buttoned and zipped. i looked like a stuffed black sausage. best for thin frames and even then  size up.
-1,I tried this dress on in store. i loved it online  but in person....not so much. it looked and felt like a cheap halloween costume. the fabric was bad. really bad.. the mustard color was beautiful.... boo
0,I love the look and feel of  this easy dress. i loved that it comes with a baby blue slip  however i was in between sizes. the medium - a bit too small and the large- just too big. this dress is probably best in a tall thin body type  especially in a madras plaid.
1,"Beautiful spring dress. perfect for luncheons or any occasion. so very pretty  lovely fabric and good fit. you will definitely feel pretty in this dress. y daughter is 5'3"" and the length was perfect."
-1,I fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw it!  unfortunately  when i went to put it on  there was a hole running down the seam in the back. i went to store to exchange  wore the shirt  and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt. horrified  i went home  took a look  both holes along the seam! i will be returning this  i really liked this shirt!
0,I love the look of this pullover  however  it was too short and heavy for my small frame with narrow shoulders. sleeves were too long as well.
1,This is a beautiful dress. figure-hugging but covered up in places that need it. color is flattering and soft. wore with bainbridge layered necklace. bought for an afternoon function and wore with pumps. so versatile  will work for church or cocktail party. great purchase!
-1,"I'm 5'7""  130 lbs. i ordered a medium-regular. the dress fell three inches above my knees. this model is taller than i am  and it falls to her knees....doesn't make sense. i think retailer sends petites in place of regular."
0,"Didn't love it  didn't hate  rather indifferent. the grey was a little more muted than i wanted for a summer tee.  i'm 5'4""  123lbs  34a  the xs fit if it wouldn't shrink  if you're about this size but larger busted go with the s."
0,This dress is beautiful  it just swallowed my small frame whole! the colors and design are gorgeous  just not a good fit for me  even at a 0p.
-1,I was so excited for this kimono. i thought the colors would be lovely. i was looking for a unique wrap/vest/kimono. i ordered this online expecting to be dazzled. sadly  i was not. this arrived and fell short on all measures. the colors were flat  the fabric felt cheap and the construction did not scream $108. it felt like something i would find in a college import/head shop. back it went. i ended up buying the silves wrap  which i love.
1,I honestly bought this shirt on a whim the other day in my local retailer. i was drawn to the color and the swing. first of all  this shirt is incredibly soft and lightweight. i love the flow of the loose peplum. the straps are nicely placed  because they're wider and accentuate my arms (and cover my bra straps). i love the little v neck detail. it shows a little cleavage when bent or hunched over  but the top stays conservative when truly upright. i wore this shirt 3 days in a row last week  and
1,"Nice fit and color and i love the tall cuff but you will need to size up at least two sizes.  as the previous reviewer stated these jeans do run extremely small.  i usually wear a 27 ag in jeans  sometimes a 28 for the ag legging jeans but the 28 in these were still very tight all over  and uncomfortable.  i don't like my jeans skin tight so i had to go up to a size 29 but they fit and look great.  sizing definitely off on these.  i am 5'3"" 115# for reference."
0,"I tried this on in the store and the colors and fabric are terrific. it's very light-weight fabric but isn't see-through. the colors are medium in depth  not too bright. if you typically wear ""cool"" colors and avoid browns  you may be able to wear this because the brown is very muted. there's two strings inside that you tie around your waist to pull the bust of the dress in. i'm 5'4"" and 125 lbs  so there's simply too much fabric in the dress. i would have bought a petite. the tag says it's avai"
1,I love the print on this. love. and the fit  for a swing blouse  was super flattering! typically i haven't found that to be true  but this one is so nice! i loved it so much  but i just couldn't find a ton of outfits to wear with such a unique piece. i have been trying to slim my closet so i did return this  but perhaps would purchase it on sale (to justify wearing it less). i typically wear a 4 in tops and dresses and took an xs.
0,I tried this dress on in the store today  and the armholes were so wide  it showed my bra under the arm almost to the bottom  and it showed part of the side cup of my bra at the front. while the dress seems like it will be really comfy  the arm cuts are so unnatural  i had to pass. i did try going down in size  and petite  and neither of those options worked to fix the situation.
-1,Very small! so disappointed! they did not even have a size for me to exchange a day later when they arrived!
1,Really nice green blend of colors. fun style but not especially figure flattering as it is a very wide peplum. i still love it and goes with many outfits and as a fall jacket. is a bit itchy. need to wear sleeved top or dress underneath.
0,This dress looked amazing in the picture. i am 5'10 and since the model was 5'9 with the dress dragging on the ground  i assumed it would be long on me as well. even with flats  this dress is an awkward length. the description says it is 62 in length but i measured it and the dress i got was 52. i will say that it's a beautiful fabric and the quality of the dress is great. it just doesn't look like the dress in the picture at all in terms of the way it hangs and the length.
-1,I ordered this blouse because it was such a good price on sale but should have paid closer attention to the reviews. the slits on the sleeves are much more noticeable than in the photo and the blouse just didn't work for me. something about it reminded me of seinfeld's pirate shirt. i appreciate retailer's return policy. i took it back to the store and got an immediate refund on my cc.
-1,This dress was very boxy and unflattering. i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back.
-1,"I agree with the first reviewer exactly. beautiful fabric and ""idea"" of dress (looks stunning on model)  but huge and shapeless in person like a tent. not at all what i expected when ordering a 2 petite. sadly  has to be returned."
-1,I tried this on in the store and i couldn't keep it on my body for more then 30 seconds. it's extremely itchy  which is a pity  because i do appreciate the design. :(
1,"I discovered seea bathing suits last year and fell in love. i currently own two - the hermosa surf suit and the . seea zuma. for reference: i am 5'7""  135 pounds  34c  28 waist. dress size 4-6. pants 6-8. jeans 28. if you have questions about sizing  there is a great reference on seea's website on how to size. if you are taller than the reference sizing they provide  but still the same measurements as another size mentioned  they suggest sizing up as the suits are typically made for surfing/padd"
1,This is a beautiful  artistic piece for your wardrobe! seriously  rosie neira is a talented  london-based designer  who will thrill you with her vision. she is expert at making a woman look amazing from every direction; these knits are stunning  the materials and workmanship flawless. the medium fits me as expected (size 8  medium top  34f). i was drawn to this by the rosie neira label  the flowing front drape and slightly longer back  the gorgeous knit quality and design  and the way it makes m
1,Regarding the product  high quality materials and overall make. extremely comfortable and flattering cut. i'd love this in all the colors of the rainbow.
-1,I love how these jeans look on. tts  adorable. i exchanged my first pair due to stitching coming out in the back right pocket. pair #2 -the stitching came out in the exact same place. this seems to be a problem with the quality/sewing. the fact that the stitching is gold and decorative as well as functional means it will keep unraveling until the jeans are ruined. 2nd pair has to go back. too bad.
0,Material and color is nice.  the leg opening is very large.  i am 5'1 (100#) and the length hits me right above my ankle.  with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle  and front pleats to make me fluffy  i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look.  if you are at least average height or taller  this may look good on you.
1,I was really pleased with this skirt. the lightness of the fabric is nice and the colors matched the photos. i was initially concerned that it might be stiff and uncomfortable  but it feels like it has a bit of stretch and offers some good movement. sometimes retailer skirts seem to run small to me  but this fit perfectly in my regularl size.
1,Wasn't sure whether i would like the top from the online picture  but it is so much more flattering in person. can be worn as a casual piece with denim skinnys or dressed up with a pencil skirt.
1,The pattern is cute and vibrant  and the shillouette is simple  but the courderoy felt too heavy and stiff and it was too small around the chest for me (36dd).
