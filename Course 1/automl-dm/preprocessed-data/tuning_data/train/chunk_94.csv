-1,I bought this very cute t-shirt in sky. wore it once  then washed it according to the washing instuctions (machine washable/dryable). this t-shirt turned into a crop top!!!!! i can't wear it. it's going to goodwill. i would suggest that you air dry this shirt  if you want to take the chance that it won't shrink up several inches.
-1,I wore this bodysuit once. it had a hole under the arm when i took it off
1,"I didn't think i would like this blouse when i saw it on the website but once i tried it on i was sold. yes  it is see-through but with a cami underneath this blouse can be worn both casually and to work. the best feature? even though it's silk and the tag says ""dry clean only""  you can absolutely hand wash this blouse in cold water and air dry. i did and it came out perfect with no wrinkles! i took my usual small (i'm 32c and 122 lbs) and love how versatile this blouse will be."
1,Love this jacket. it's soft and a beautiful shade of ivory. perfect for casual wear with a pair of black jeans  while still maintaining an elegant look.
0,This dress has a beautiful color and design. however it runs too big. i'm usually between size 2 or 4 on antropologie's cloths. i had to size down to size 0 to get a more fitted look like the model.
1,This jacket is so well made and absolutely beautiful. i usually wear a size 4 or small in everything at retailer. sadly i ordered a small and will have to return it  too tight on chest and arms. i recommend going a size up. also this jacket is really cropped  probably needs a hifh waist pant to compliment it  otherwise might appear too short.
-1,There are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted. not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress. i wish the pictures shown were more accurate.
0,This may be lovely on some people but it didn't work on me at all. i thought it would have some swing to it but the bottom hem was tight. if i had gone up a size  the top would have been huge. the bib wasn't flattering on me and it's also quite sheer. too bad because the print is great. maybe if you're athletic with slim hips you can manage it. i think if you are busty this could look like maternity wear on you. back it went  sadly.
1,Love to just throw on this shirt with whatever accessories and skinny jeans. easy to wear and very comfortable
1,Comfortable t eh fabric is very soft. the embroidery adds a little to the otherwise plain black tunic. lace up neck on trend too.     i ordered the xxs p  as it is likely loose... that was just fine for me  xs p would have been not as flattering. theo nly problem with that is the sleeves then became a little more snug (workout arms). not too snug that i can't wear the dress  but decided not to keep it only because there are way too many things i like at retailer! (and have to pick). in my wish lis
0,This shirt is adorable  love the lace detail on the sides  but way too boxy for me. it's a great lighter weight for spring  but it doesn't feel flimsy. sadly  there isn't any shape to help make this flattering. it will be returned.
1,I'm 7months preggars and this top actually compliments my belly. extremely comfortable.
0,Color not as vibrant as in the picture. skirt is darted  which is not clearly seen in the picture. (assumed would be cut on the bias  which i'm more familiar with in slip dresses.) i didn't fill in the bust and the style is such that it isn't possible to compensate with helpful undergarments. while not for me  i'm still recommending it because it may fit others better. reviewers are instructed to avoid writing about customer service  but i feel compelled to note that the customer service i have
-1,I'm usually a fan of maeve  but this dress is just bad. the fabric is thin and filmy  and it stretches to sheer over your chest. the turtleneck is neither tight nor loose  it just droops in a most unfortunate way.
1,Fit is oversized but intentional. flattering on. love the neckline. modesty might call for a tank top underneath if bending over. fabric is soft  stretchy and has a good quality heft to it.
0,"I ordered the neutral and this dress feels and looks great. but my issue is with the fabric. while very comfortable  it fades where its stretched. so around my bust and my back when i moved my arms. i am 5'9""  145 lbs and the small fit me the best but i tried on the medium just to see if it was a fit issue. the fabric still looked weird. i'm disappointed to send it back but i just can't keep it."
0,I liked the color of this top but i didn't really like the ruffled stitching around the middle. it looks like someone just tacked on the bottom half. i bought this for my daughter and she likes it. i think it is comfortable and a good top to knock around in.
1,"This dress is so flattering on  i was astounded. often the ""waistline"" in the petite dress are very high  even though i'm only 5'1"" tall  but this one hit at the right place and the skirt made me feel slim and tall. the fabric feels silky and the pattern is nice  but it is a pretty conservative style and perhaps a bit dark for spring. would be great for work  or church  but unfortunately doesn't really fit my lifestyle and i personally prefer a more unique style for the price. i highly recommend"
0,I bought the cream version online  as the blue was sold out. i was rather disappointed to see that the cream is just a glorified sweatshirt. there are no dots  it it just the heathered cream of any normal sweatshirt. i do  however  like the design and the fit of the sweatshirt. i am sad that is was not clear (in the photos or in the name) that the cream version was not dotted. i am still deciding if i will keep the shirt. i love the design and fit  but the plain boring sweatshirt was not what i
-1,The material is adorable and if it was available in a blouse with sleeves  i would buy in a minute. we have a pool and i thought it would be cute to wear while entertaining. now the cons  i am long waisted and this strange tie knotted high under the bustline giving an odd lumpy look. it runs short and i can't imagine who thought this design was a good idea. there were no reviews when i ordered. i am learning to try it on in the store and/or read the reviews before investing. i would say go up a
0,They are beautiful in person  until you put the on. the fit was a bit weird; tighter in the waist  roomy in the crotch. the fabrics work 100% against one another. the vegan leather  especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams  is too stiff. the back is thin and has far too much elasticity. at $150 i passed. these will only enter my closet on sale.
-1,This dress is huge. i am normally a l-xl regular in retailer brands. i love a loose  flowy dress. after trying one on in the store (just a random returned petite xl) i ordered the petite medium. and it was still huge and not flattering. so sad. i wanted to love this- loved the material and colors  but way off.
-1,I absolutely fell in love with these comfy palazzo pants and imagined that i'd be wearing them all summer long. they fit beautifully  were true to size  and seemed to go with every top i owned. unfortunately  on the second wear  the inseam completely unraveled  leaving a foot-long gaping hole in the leg. i also noticed some stray threads along the other seams  so i'm not thrilled with the quality. it seems like they were poorly manufactured. i'm not sure if i just purchased a faulty pair or if t
0,These pants are cute. they seem  to me  to have a wider leg than appears on the model. they do run big  so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt. these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down  but unfortunately  look pretty sloppy by the end of the day  as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly. since they already run a bit big  this is a major negative. i wore them to church  and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home. by late afternoon  they looked like a different pair of pants.
0,I have a few pairs of the stevie ankle  so i thought i try these. they have very little stretch and feel tight in the waist. the distressing near the front pockets is really apparent...like white stripes. they make the jean look overall cheap. not worth $198  in my opinion.
1,Crazy soft and comfy.  light weight so will be great for spring/ summer and layering.  so happy i bought it.
0,I loved this dress the minute i tried it on and am actually really sad that i had to return it. however  the embroidery was unraveling in several places before i'd even worn it  so i thought it would probably only get worse. too bad because it's gorgeous and flattering!
0,I usually wear an 8  which wasn't available  and sized up to the 10 which fit just fine as there is no stretch and it's a set-in waist band. the fabric is pretty  the skirt is fully lined  the length is not too short  and the only thing i don't like is the big bronzey toothed zipper - it looks ok on the beige version  but on the black it stands out.    it's perfect for summer but i could also see wearing the black version during holidays.
-1,This hoodie was too thin. you can see right through it. i returned it.
0,I received this skirt today and was very disappointed. i don't know what i expected but it is not as i thought. even though the quality is very good and the fit is true to size  i may return it. the fabric of the skirt is just too busy  at least for me. i am just uncertain and even though i have many tops  the colors are just not matching. white looks better than any colored top with this particular print. i am going to try it on one more time and make a definite decision.
0,This is  like many reviewers stated  a very flattering and nice dress. the sleeves were particularly great  because they are slightly longer than most of this type and went past the meaty (for lack of a better word!) part of my arm  only exposing the slimmer bits. it looked great on me  and i imagine it would on most people. i just did not like the handkerchief hem....too young  too trendy? i don't know  when you're in your 40s  you start to feel ridiculous in certain styles! i just didn't feel
-1,I ordered these a size up because i'd just had a baby and knew i needed a bigger size. my pre-pre baby size (chubby phase) were size 8/29. these fit like a size 4. way too small. very disappointed!
1,I got this in the color listed as pink. it's not a usual pink. the fit is good--not too tight and not too loose. the length is good for a tee.
-1,The fabric of this looks and feels so cheap it's hard to believe this is anna sui. i would say this is unwearable. there is zero stretch and it is made of itchy textured poly fabric that looks like novelty fabric at best. going back asap.
-1,This top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag  with only a quick ironing. unfortunately  the first time i washed it (cold water  hang dry)  it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy  is much shorter  and feels rougher to the touch. like another reviewer said (unfortunately  after i had purchased and washed!)  i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only  because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno
0,"Agree with other reviewers: this runs narrow in the skirt. the top is also quite low-cut  and it's already lined so i can't see wearing a cami or slip. i like the black-and-white print and the shape  and might have tried a size larger in the store. finally  it's an awkward  unflattering length. i'm 5'4"" and it hit below my knee."
-1,Horrible fit. i do not understand why they but a aline dress with a skin non aline camisole under the dress.
-1,I ordered this shirt online and didn't even try it on... it is super see through and i would need to wear a tank underneath and i don't want to have that extra layer in the summer.  it is cute though!
1,Wearing this today! it fits true is size & is machine washable. the slits make it unique. don't hesitate to purchase this one.
-1,"I am almost always an xs in bottoms (sz 0-2) but literally couldn't get the stretchy waistband (no zip or fastening) in xs up my hips. in addition  the ""brocade"" is a very lightweight polyestery  tinselly weave--does not suggest quality. as others have noted  it also runs short; i'm 5'3'' and this was a little below knee length on me  not ankle-length. i've had luck with retailer's sale section in the past  including some items that didn't always start off with the best reviews  but have no regret"
1,I was a bit unsure when ordering because of the cut of this blouse. i have a lean athletic torso but i am a 32dd. sometimes tops like this can make me look heavy or pregnant. love the fit though. it fits lovely and comfy. it goes well with jeans or cream colored pants and will be a nice addition to my spring wardrobe.
1,This is a beautiful dress that glides over your body and swishes around when you walk. i received many compliments when i wore this  with black korkease platform sandals and peruvian opal jewelry. the fit is true to size  i took my usual size l. it is longer on me than the model  and my only complaint is the slip-it is very sheer and you can see your legs through the slip and the dress together  so i had to find a different slip. i think retailer should also make their slips a bit longer  i don't
-1,I love baseball tees and this looked like a more refined version  but it was huge and shapeless.  nice material and fabric but this one is going back.
0,I thought i'd like this dress in the neutral color. i had to return it it as it was quite unflattering. the skirt made my hips look big and the uneven shape didn't help. the top fit well  in my usual 4 petite  i think it would look nice on some people  as it's something different but i am not one of those it worked on.
1,I'm glad i tried this on. i was drawn to the burgundy and pink floral print  but i wasn't so sure about the cut or style of the top. once it was on  however  i loved it. i don't much care for the a-line tops that remind me of maternity wear. they're cute on rail-thin  young girls  but not so much on mom-bod women in their 40s. this top is the exception. the details from the buttons to the thin pleats  the unique cut of the bust-line and the print make this top both lovely and flattering. i wore
-1,So i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about  but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point (and intent) at retailer  so i had hopes. i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days  but it's honestly so thin i couldn't even see it working that well for that. it's also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model; my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti
-1,"The picture makes the pants appear flattering and comfortable. but they are not flattering at all. they seemed much bigger than they should have been and the ""fold over"" portion was not necessary."
1,This.  an unexpected purchase...i found this on my way to the dressing room.  the fit is stunning. i sized way down (i.e. normally wear 10/12  curvy  and bought a small).  it accentuates my curves  and is incredibly flattering. i bought the navy  and will be adding another color soon!  the material is viscose blend - soft and flowy. it's a nice addition to my work wardrobe.
1,Thank goodness i packed this on a recent trip to adirondacks because it kept me warm in the cool mountain weather. i love gray so i was drawn to this open stitch sweater. it is a boxy bulky look but a great layering piece. most bulk is in front  so it can camouflage areas. i wore this over a gray and black flannel plaid shirt. perfect!
0,I wanted to love this so much! i am 5'8 and normally do a size large in retailer  but based on the previous review i sized down. the top fit fine  but the bottom just sort of poofed out. not flattering. it does have pockets which are amazing  but overall  just wasn't a good fit. the top is t-shirt material  not denim.
-1,"I usually wear a medium and bought a small. it fit ok  but had no shape and was not flattering. i love baby doll dresses and tops  but this was a tent. my daughter saw me try it on and said ""that's a piece of tablecloth."" it's going back."
-1,This  is more of a cover up than something you would wear out .
0,"Beautiful. got several compliments when wearing it. does not hold up with washes though. threads unraveling everywhere. i am thinking of returning it for this reason. fits true to size. i am 5'4"" 118 lbs  xs fit. i am smaller on top."
1,I am kicking myself for listening to an earlier negative review and not ordering this dress months ago. i finally took a chance on clearance and i love it! the knit fabric is soft and beautiful! so is the design and construction. the fabric is very light and delicate. all the details on the dress are just top notch. the body of the dress is lined  but the sleeves are not - so there's a slight see-through effect on the sleeves  showing the lovely and delicate knit. it fits like a dream  and i've
-1,The sweater material was fragile. there were already two picks in the fabric when it arrived. i felt like it would not wear or wash well. i was also disappointed in the shaping or how it hung on my body. i am returning the sweater.
0,I was really looking forward to getting this dress in the orange print  but when i finally received  i was a little disappointed. the print placement is not the same as shown on the model  so it doesn't look as a vibrant and colorful. my version of the dress has more of that muddy dark print and hardly any orange or turquoise. also the backside of the print is white and the dress is not lined. i do like the way it drapes on my body and the overall styling. the dress fits nicely in size medium on
1,Almost perfect! this jacket doesn't have that weird vegan smell. it's soft  smooth  and very high quality. this jacket is also a nice surprise for us busty ladies. i'm a 32ddd and the m fit nicely  no squishing (as the other reviewers have said  the chest has room!).     i got the gray  and i loved it it's soft tint. i returned it because the lower band of the jacket sits right at my widest part of my torso  my post-baby belly. the jacket is sort of short like a peplum  and i want to hide the st
0,"I think these jeans are good for people with long lean legs. i'm 5'7"" 155 lbs and the wide cuff made my legs look short and stubby. the weight of the jeans is a little on the heavier side - i usually like soft denim. i usually wear a 31 and thought they were true to size."
-1,My husband never has anything negative to say about my clothes until i wore these pants! they are not flattering and kept stretching out until i could pull them off without unzipping them! baggy in the behind and sloppy looking. they are going back asap!
1,"This is a love at first sight item! bought that home after seeing it on the model. very soft and lovely! especially love the tie back! i wore it with a t shirt underneath. i am 5'4"" and size small. i bought xs and still a bit long. wish they have petite at the store."
-1,"This dress is horrible. i can't believe they can get away with calling it a ""dress"". it should have been called a tunic or shirt. it looks like it is a soft flowing dress made out of nice material from the pictures  no way. it is made from sweatshirt material it is lifeless and is kind of stiff. it came to the top of my thighs. i can't find one nice thing to say about this dress and i do not recommend it. the picture does it so much more justice that it is worth."
1,"I bought this blouse in the purple motif and love it for work. great design and print. based on the existing reviews  i sized down from my normal xs to an xxs and i actually wish that i would have stuck with the xs only because the blouse is tighter on my biceps than i would prefer  but i am keeping the blouse. i always appreciate this in other reviews  so hopefully it helps: i'm 5'2""  117 lbs  and a small 32b."
1,Cozy  soft fabric.  love the snails on the pockets and the cute buttons.  size down if you want a more tailored fit.
0,The pattern is cute. it's a little more subtle than in the photos. the problems were the skirt are 1: pretty sure it will wrinkle in two seconds and 2: it has buttons down the front of it with no lining behind it. which means  if you sit down wearing this skirt and it doesn't lay quite right  it gaps and you can see whatever is or is not underneath! the buttons are like two inches apart  so it's not a tiny little gap. no thanks. also  this skirt fir true to size  it wasn't tight  just gappy.
-1,I love the design of this top  however  it's quality is lackluster. the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering (at least on me) if it had a few more inches. also it's pretty sheer  so figuring out under garments is a dilemma. i will still wear it because i love it. looks great with a denim vest over it!
-1,The top ran too large and it made me look more bustier than i am and rounder in my midsection by how it fell on me. maybe would've been better for someone with a smaller bust. the quality of the fabric was just okay.
1,Needed a pair of grey pants to go with some of my jewel colored tops.  hei hei is my favorite brand of pants and these did not disappoint.  they fit like a glove and are true to size.  i don't think the picture does them justice.  if you like comfort you certainly will not go wrong with these pants.  you can wear them year round except in the heat of the summer.  i would not hesitate to purchase them.
1,I treated myself to get this at full-price at the start of summer. my size is xl and it fits me like the model photos. i have gotten such good use out of this blouse. it washes well without shrinking. it's vintage-looking. so comfortable. i love the arm coverage  interesting neckline that covers bra straps  good length. the cami it came with is flimsy so i threw it away. i use another tank underneath. i'd love any of the colors. the blus was more my color but all of them are gorgeous because of
0,Nice quality and feel to the fabric but they are super lightweight and do not come down to the ankle. they fall at a strange place on the calf - a better cropped summer pant  perhaps.
0,"Recently started loving rockets. i own a pair in black and a pair that are distressed. i've found that the 27s fit me best. i am 5'7""  34c  28 waist. this particular pair seems to run true to size  meaning i could get the 28s on (which is typically what i wear in other brands)  but the 27s were embarassingly too small. while the 28s fit  and are made of a great weighty denim  with very little stretch  the wash was really not appealing. due to the distressing of the wash  all the lines butterfly"
