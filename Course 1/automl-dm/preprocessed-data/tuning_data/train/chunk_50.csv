1,"I received this top over the weekend and i absolutely love it! it does not smell  nor does it itch  as the other reviewer stated... at least not for me. i was worried about the green color  but it's quite lovely. this is a keeper for me! i am 5'1""  but ordered the regular xs  and i am happy with the length."
0,So i thought this sweater would be snowy white  but it's actually a beige kind of dingy color. i do not mean that it's unattractive  i do like it  just because it is not snowy white like i thought  it makes it more of a casual sweater in my opinion and i was hoping for a dressy sweater. it is very super soft and is as long as it is pictured. it fits like a dolman sweater which i did not expect either. it's a bit fitted around the very bottom and sleeves are billowy at the top.the picture does no
1,"This is truly the best black dress...you can wear to sooo many things. a long time keeper for the closet. i felt it ran a little bit big...i am normally an 8-10...i bought both sizes (8 and 10)...kept the 8...but felt i could even get away with a 6...but didn't want to pay shipping again for another size. i am 5'7"" and 155lbs. it is truly a flattering dress for any figure."
-1,I wanted to love this as i love holding horses but it fits weird  slender in arms but baggy in the torso. i will be returning
1,Very versatile dress.  runs a bit large i am 5 foot 2 (105 lbs) and ordered the xs petite and it fit perfectly!
-1,Loved the material and the style. unfortunately  my fears came true when i received this swimsuit  and there wasn't enough support despite a review i had read. as a 36d  i thought the halter would be enough support  however  the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely. i am sad i won't be keeping this though. the material is heavenly!!!
0,"Really wanted to like this top. the model has it on backwards - the ""v"" is actually the back and closes with an eye hook (that is where the tag is ? there's also a seam running down the back). the front is actually a high round neck. the material has a metallic thread and felt rather scratchy cheap. i'm usually a s or xs. in this top the s had too much material at the bottom and flared out strangely. the xs was too short in the front and moving your arms caused it to ride up."
1,I love this skirt!! it slips seamlessly from day to night  and looks great on those of us who happen to be on the taller side. it's super warm  so it's perfect with tights and boots on those colder winter evenings out.
0,This is a very pretty top - flowy w/o making you look larger  a nice blue  and a good transition piece. but  the upper arms are so tight on me! i'd say i have pretty average arms - definitely not super thin  but not large either. i keep staring at it and hoping the fabric will give a bit so i can keep it  but sadly  i just don't think the material will be very forgiving. if you have truly thin arms  i think it would be a great top. maybe sizing up would also work  but for me at least  i think it
0,Has i read the reviews would have realized the t-shirt looking sleeves in the pic are attached to the sweater. based on the pic and site description i didnt realize they were attached. i thought it was part of the styling of the undershirt. i think this very much limits the versatility of the sweater. i ordered the white which is a beautiful color and very soft. i am returning it cause i do not like the t-shirt sleeve. would rather have the flexibility to layer whatever shirt i wanted
-1,While i love the design and shape of this blouse  the fabric was of very poor quality. i will return it.
-1,I bought this dress for a holiday party  and the sequins on the dress were so much more blue that what it looks like in the photo. i still liked it  but when i went to try it on  it was just not working. i thought this was more of a loosely fitted look  but the upper bodice and waist seam are very tightly fitted. i would recommend sizing up  but be aware that the top straps (shoulder to breast) are too loose to begin with  so they may sag.  overall  i wouldn't recommend this dress for the curren
-1,"The dress is absolutely beautiful in person. the blue stripes are a bit brighter and the print on top is more muted. it's unique and sure to turn heads. being 5'2"" i tried on the small petite. this size is usually perfect (lengthwise) for me. however this dress was about 2"" too long. another complaint is the style of the top half. the model in the picture seems to be hiding the puffiness of the top half. the top half puffs out and made me appear much wider than i am. not a good look on anyone."
-1,I own two poodles and love anything poodle print. i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale. but it is horrible. the fit is like wearing a pillowcase. it was about 5 inches too wide on each side while the arms fit. it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short  wide  and wrong. i was in love with the print however i had to return it.
-1,Did not work for me. material was a bit thin  poor quality  the tie doesn't quite work correctly. had a cheaper look to it. not the quality i'd normally expect. this is going back.
0,I loved the color of this shirt but it does run big. i even sized down and it was still large on me and the ruffles flare out a bit which was not flattering one me. it looks pretty on the hangar.
1,This sweater coat is perfect. i've been looking for one i loved for years. in my opinion  it runs true to size. i ordered my usual xsp. it is fitted in the arms and loose on the body. i love it.
0,"I think these are amazing for anyone over  say  5'5"". the way these hung on me (at 5'2"") were very unflattering in the front. they had an unfortunate masculine effect to them. that's all i can say without being crass."
-1,The cowl and cuffs of the dress are thick and heavy sweater material  but the dress itself is extremely thin. the non-belted pictures do not show how much volume there is to the dress  which was enormous in my normal size.
-1,I wanted to love this. couldn't wait for it to arrive.  unfortunately  it doesn't look anything like the picture.  i usually wear a m/l in holding horses so i ordered a l but as soon as i held it up i noticed it was ridiculously large. the fabric is on the heavy side so the dress just hangs in a very unflattering way. and  it is extremely shimmery.  i love velvet  but the texture and sheen of this dress was just over the top. sadly  it is going back.
0,"I am 5'4"" about 120# with an athletic build. i was so excited for this dress to arrive. when i removed it from the package i loved the way it felt and the weight of it. the color was as pictured on my computer. i ordered the xsp and was concerned it would be too small in the shoulders or too short. it was huge on me -- too long -- too wide -- too frumpy -- too loose all over. i checked to make certain it was a petite that was sent and it was. boo. i do like the cap sleeve better than the flutter"
-1,So much extra fabric. not something i would recommend buying online.
-1,Unique print but not great execution. the pant legs are very tight  i have average sized calves and i sized up one size. the hook closure was oddly tight and difficult to clasp. when i first saw the color it looked like burnt sienna or a dried blood color. too bad this didn't work out.
1,Wonderful dress! thank you for making a fun and sassy dress that actually fits me! normally this sort of dress wouldn't fit  with it failing me in the bust  but it fit quite well. in most cases  i would end-up in a 12 petite to accommodate my bust  but with it then too large in the shoulders  or  the dress would have run so small  i wouldn't have been able to button it in most places. i was pleasantly surprised not only with the fit  but the quality  as well.  as described by other reviewers  it
0,While there is nothing wrong with this top  it didn't really have an retailer feel. it looked more like something from a dept store  maybe a boutique. i got on sale but sending back bc i just don't like it that much  especially next to my pale skin. i could see it looking much better in someone with darker skin tone. i'm usually a 8/10 med. small in this top fit well.
0,I saw this top on sale and tried it on right away. my normal medium was too big  so i purchased the small in the rose color. wore it with a shimmery kimono and cream colored pilcro boyfriend jeans. wow  what an outfit!!!!  then i washed it according to directions  and sadly it shrunk into a crop peplum tank. i was so disappointed. i wished i had read the reviews beforehand.
1,Feels great  flows nicely  and love the pockets that hide pretty much everything from a lipstick container to a phone.
1,"What a great top! i am 5'9"" - 136 lbs with a 34d chest.. and this top looks and feels great on. i am usually a 6 and the small fit perfectly. i purchased the grey and it is a nice medium grey color. the v in front hits in a great spot.. not too low  but just low enough to look feminine. i haven't washed and dried the top yet  so i hope it looks as good after washing as it does brand new. i was hesitant to order because of the earlier reviews  but i find this top really works for me  so i am glad"
-1,It's a beautiful top but not for bigger busts. ordered an xl and the top part would not button. i recommend for those with smaller busts.
1,This is absolutely beautiful. the picture online doesn't do it justice. i slipped this on with skinny jeans in the store and was hooked instantly. fit was a little large. i would have tried a petite but this shirt doesn't come in petite sizes. love this!
0,"This sweater was a little bit of a let down. i ordered the pink and it is actually a tan sweater with (bright) coral material woven throughout. it wasn't the 'soft pink/coral' color that it appeared to be online. while the material is very cozy  the sweater itself is short and boxy. i would've like the width better if the length would've been a little more proportionate. i am 5' 0"" and ordered a petite small. probably returning."
-1,Super cute but the fabric was so thin & flimsy i was afraid it would fall apart once it was washed so returned it.
0,"Maybe i just have the wrong body type for these jeans  but even though they technically fit  i felt like they looked like ""mom jeans"" on me. i was fine with the high waist  which actually made them very comfortable  but the ankles were loose and long on me  where most ag ankle jeans are a perfect length. the quality is good though--the fabric is substantial and a bit stiffer than most of my other ag's  and the color is a nice saturated black. i tried on a size 27  and i'm 5'4""  120 lbs."
0,This dress has way too much material. the material is really soft and beautiful but there's too much of it. it feels like you're wearing a big sack. sadly i'll be returning it.
1,This shirt fits really well- i ordered a size small and it's definitely a bit form fitting. i was a little bit hesitant to purchase this at first- for a tshirt it's a pretty hefty price. but the quality and cut are really quite attractive and worth every penny.
0,I absolutely love the look and fit of these jeans. i did have to size down. i ran into problems after washing. the fraying on one leg was twice that of the other  looking very unbalanced. after looking closely i found that one leg had a top stitching very close to the fray to prevent further fraying. the other leg did not have this stitching  thus the fraying double in size. i have sent a request to customer service for a replacement pair. these are adorable jeans just be sure to check for stitc
-1,These are very pretty  but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package  i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however  even though they are machine washable  i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also  the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing  which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants.
0,The fit was fine  but the fabric (the beige option) was bland. it washed me out. granted  i'm fair skinned  but it reminded me of sour milk. it's getting returned.
-1,On my screen this looked like burnt oranges were mixed with pink but this was all pink & very washed put pinks - looked awful on me as brunette. maybe will work for someone who likes pastels. overall style was also disappointing- just hung. this went back.
0,Nice jeans  just fyi they look more slimly fitted in the photo than they actually are when you get them. that's why i returned them. otherwise  fine.
1,Nice stretchy shirt. nothing special so i wouldn't pay more than sale price.
0,I really wanted to love this top. i got it in xs in peach. the color is beautiful. i wish they had this exact same color in the boardwalk stroll top. the v neck was way too low and i don't want to have to wear a tank underneath. i would be willing to try an xxs but it's been sold out for awhile now and looks like it's not coming back. if the size were smaller  v neck higher up  and the top portion of the dress more fitted  it would be the perfect tee!
0,I returned this as it was way too boxy/loose. ordered a size small but probably needed to size down.
-1,Was really excited for this dress but should have paid more attention to the material it was made with. for the price of the dress  it felt very cheap. i didn't even end up trying it on after i opened the packaging. the colors were not as vibrant as the picture. as another reviewer mentioned  it was more similar to something you would purchase off a boardwalk. very disappointed and will be returning.
0,I was really looking forward to getting this top but what a disappointment. it is absolutely huge! i normally wear a large and i think a small would have fit me and a small never fits me. too bad cause it's such a pretty top. p.s. this has an attached camis (which i hate).
0,The pattern is very cute!  from the front i liked it  but when i turn to the side  you can see just how voluminous it is.  it ended up looking a bit tenty.  if it had just a bit more shape it would be perfect.  in the end  not the most flattering.
1,Great fit and dark color; thick yet very soft denim. only surprise for me was that the lacing is in the front (i was expecting it to be on the sides)  but i love them anyway!
1,I bought this blouse after i saw my aunt wearing it. the color is lovely. i spilled soup on it during my first wearing and it laundered wonderfully. i am so glad! such an easy piece to throw on  very comfortable. fit is great.
1,"This pink tank is a wonderful addition to my go-to basics. i love the color  which is a nice deep pink that is pretty spot on in terms of accuracy to the online photo. it is a wonderful comfy fabric and the side knot adds nice visual interest to make this top appealing and unique. i also appreciate the wide straps  which means i can wear a normal bra instead of a strapless one without worrying about straps playing peek-a-boo. the only drawback is size. i ordered my usual xs (i am 5'5""  110 lbs "
1,Purchased this t-shirt in white. it's lightweight and slightly sheer. perfect for layering. looks cute with a poncho  blazer or on it's own. really wish it was available in black.
-1,I purchased this shirt in white and black. the white is more ivory-isn  and is a bit thin/see through. the shirts can be worn with jeans  or dressed up with a skirt. i just wish it was a little more form fitting. i do like the hint of stretch in the fabric! very comfortable as well!
0,"I wanted to love this dress. i ordered an xsmall and a small. i am 5'6"" and 110 lbs  slender build. the xsmall fit great everywhere but the waist band was completely out of portion for the dress. both sizes will have to be returned. possibly if you have a more straight up and down figure it will fit better and pull in your waist!"
-1,Looks great in the picture but when i got this in the mail the fabric was so stiff! shaking it out did nothing-almost like it was dipped in drying glue. i got this for $10 which is so cheap and i still returned it!
1,This is a unique blouse  it reminds me of the unique items i would find at the store many years ago. it is a gorgeous item. it does have a boxy fit  but it is not unflattering. i am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product.   the quality is nice and it is an item that people will notice.
1,I love every other byron lars dress i've bought and this was a no brainer for me. when it arrived i was really disappointed. the fabric is very stretchy which makes it super forgiving and very thick. with all the buttons planted on this dress i was expecting it to open easily from the front as one of my other dresses by his does. nope. only the back buttons open. thick stretchy fabric and back buttons...not an easy thing to navigate. i was also very sad to see that the length was all wrong for m
0,The smallest size  xs  was big on me  i was overwhelmed by the sweater. it is a bit of swing shape  doesn't hug the body. sleeves are interesting though  but not flattering on a petite frame. color is a pretty green  made me think of wintergreens. fabric may be itchy to some. just ok for me.    for reference xs bog on 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.
-1,I really wanted to like this dress. the color is perfect  the design and cut are cut (not always the case at retailer). however  the fabric quality was terrible - a shiny acrylic with cheap nylon lace. it looked like something from a discount store and had to go back.
0,This sweater is ok. i love  love  love bell sleeves so i thought for sure this would be perfect. i thought it would be a great sweater to transition from winter to spring  but once it arrived  i knew i had to return. the sleeves are not only bell but very long and the sweater fits chunky on your midsection. i like my sweaters more flowy. if you like fitted-style sweaters that are a bit roomy you would like this once. also  it's a bit itchy for me-but i'm rather sensitive and if i'd loved this on
0,Purchased these pants that i had quickly tried on. when i got home  i re-tried them and felt they were too snug and the material had an odd feel and did not lay right. i took them back and tried them in the next size. they fit much better but the material did not lay well on me. i think that they are a bit too stretchy and ended up not buying the larger ones either. i would definitely recommend trying these in a store rather then ordering online.
-1,On me  thsi was ginormous  looked like a mu mu. it is pretty  but there was just too much fabric  even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice  and it looks pretty  but overwhelming. i will say  i think it would work on tail lean people  i have pretty muscular shoulders  so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier  no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try  just not for me...    ref: 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.
-1,Really disappointing quality. these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month! i love pilcros  and am totally shocked at the poor quality...retailer  i hope this is just a fluke. not worth the money!
-1,"The color says red but it's more like a rust. i'm 5'3"" so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything.    finally returned it without it making it out the door :("
1,I had to order this dress three times to get the correct size. ordered a petite which worked great. i really like the dress now that i found the size that fits best. love the color! perfect for so many occasions  church  special events and dinner out. great with flats and wedges. i know i will be wearing it lots this summer. did i mention i love the color! worth repeating.
1,First thing i would say these pants run large i'm a size 6 the size 4 fit perfect i love the style and look of the cascade fabric on leg of these pants but these pants are a little heavy still a beautiful pant
0,I loved the design of the top! it looks great in person too. i am typically a size 12 top  and i ordered a size l. i could barely get the top on  and once on  it was super tight around my armpit area and waist. i am going to exchange it for an xl and hope that that will fit. the fabric has no give or stretch; it is tight fitting. underneath the ruffles the top looks like a halterneck tank top style.
1,I loved the mustard colored version of this skirt for summer and was thrilled to see it reissued in darker hues. same comfortable fit and cool textured fabric that doesn't wrinkle. i found the regular sizing to still be above the knee and the wide elastic waistband great for either a cropped top or a belt. will wear often.
-1,I was excited to receive this top. it looked great online  vibrant colors with the beautiful detail on the sleeves. when i tried it on  the fabric looked and felt cheap. it is not a flowy top. do not recommend it.
-1,"These pants are more like 9"" not 10"". i was very dissappointed. the color is great and so is the fabric.  if you look more closely at the model the pants don't fit her either!! they are too small! i haven't decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight. i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer"
1,"Beautiful  feminine  flowy dress. love the brass button detail at neckline and around waist-gives the otherwise delicate dress a pop of ""edge"". had to detach the slip to get it on  but glad it is included with the dress. i purchased the small and fits like a glove (5'8""  135lbs  34d). can't wait to wear it!!"
1,"These are great quality and hang very nice. tts. i'm 5'6"" and about 130lbs and the 2 fit and hit just above the ankle."
1,I bought this dress for an upcoming bridal shower i am attending. it fits great  is flattering  and i can also wear it to work since it is long enough.    overall it was a great purchase!
1,"This is just a fantastic dress! i bought it in my usual m in the blue and it fits like a glove. i love the varying lengths and the adorable sleeves and the substantial knit which feels amazing on the body without revealing any bumps and lumps :) i took the regular length and found it perfect. the front hits about two inches above my knee and the rest hits a bit lower. i'm only 5""1  but i prefer dresses that hit closer to my knee than mini so the regular was perfect for me  definitely a keeper!"
