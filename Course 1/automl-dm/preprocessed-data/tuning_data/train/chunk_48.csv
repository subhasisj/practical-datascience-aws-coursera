-1,Although beautiful colors this eyelet dress is quite heavy and the buttons have no give- one of them literally cracked when i tried to unbutton it. unbuttoning it was difficult due to the tight weave. it just misses the mark and will be going back.
-1,I read all the reviews about the fabric being see through  but liked the dress enough to give it a shot. it is soooo see through. this trally could only be worn on a beach. very disappointed.
0,This sweater was unflattering me  very boxy and did not fall on me like the model. soft fabric and looks nice off  however this one went back.
-1,This dress had so much potential. looked cute when i received it. put it on & couldn't wait to take it off. it's shapeless  top heavy & just overall unflattering. the material could be cute....on a totally different dress. don't waste your money.
1,"I saw this dress in the store and immediately grabbed it. i think that if i'd only seen it online i wouldn't have looked at it twice. in person  the fabric is so beautiful  a shining and classy velvet crinkle that could go way way dressy with the right accessories. this dress runs large  like all of floreat's items. i am 5'2"" 110# and normally wear an xs or 0  but had to size down to xxs petite for the right fit (like on the model). the only drawback is dry clean only. based on the content of th"
1,I love the dress!  i purchased this dress to wear on my honeymoon to paris.  it made me feel like a princess walking around the gardens of versalles while wearing it!
-1,I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.
0,I had high hopes for this coat  but it was a miss for me. while the wool is soft and not itchy  the colors are a lot duller in person and the embroidery looks messy.  also  the fit runs large with an unflattering poof in the back where the pleat is located.  i thought about keeping it since i liked how soft the wool was  but alas  i just could not get over the poor tailoring.  for reference i am usually a pxxs ( 5ft2in 105 lbs) and it was big.
0,"I like what they were going for here  and the fabric. but it falls short in that i can't wear it to work---the back ""keyhole"" is massive so i can't wear my normal bras  and the very wide neck also shows bra straps  so unless i want to go with a strapless bra  it's not useful for me. i want to feel loose and soft and summer comfy and my strapless bras are anything but that. i'd go without  but that is a no-no where i work. i may try getting a size smaller. i wear a med. and i got a small and mayb"
-1,I really wanted to love this waistcoat. i purchased this online and tried it on as soon as i received it. it runs large  but i should have realized the horizontal stripes sitting on the hips is not a good thing. the fur adds additional bulk where it is not needed  the hip area !!!!. i purchased a small and could have purchase a xs  but i think the problem would still be there in a smaller size. it's going back  but i am disappointed as i really wanted a something a little alternative !!!!!
0,The fit is a little bit odd  it is short and wide  too much fabric. the quality is not good  the buttons can easily break and the stitching was falling apart. i am returning it.
1,Loved this dress but ran much larger than other maeve dresses i have ordered in the past!
1,I bought this lightweight duster in the cream color. it runs a little large through the shoulders so i sized down from my usual l to a size m. its very flattering on  and made with natural fibers such as cotton and linen. i wear this unbuttoned with a tank top  cropped jeans  and sandals.
-1,This dress is really nice and lightweight. the slip is snug so the outer part floats nicely. but..it adds a bit too much volume if you have a lot of curves. it disguises in a way but also is a bit less flattering. i really wanted to like it because it's so breezy but a tad matronly on me.
0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top."
1,I haven't worn it yet. i tried it on when i got it and like it alot
1,I bought this top to have so that i can pair it with a lot of my other wardrobe pieces. the top is amazing! it is soft  great fabric  a cute cut  and can be styled in so many ways! definitely worth the buy!
-1,I'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses  especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made.     it was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it's the petite size.     do not buy. i'm very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this.
1,I bought this dress in the store and realized that it was a little too long for my frame...i'm 5'1. i then found it online in the same size but in petite and it fits perfectly! i got a ton of compliments and i wore it to a holiday wedding and am planning on wearing it to several other occasions over the holidays. would def recommend this dress.
-1,I ordered these in both colors. the red is much deeper in person  more like a burgundy than pictured here. these tees are very slouchy. if you wanted a more fitted look  size down. these are very soft and very comfy and will pair well with ponte leggings and skinny jeans. the overall quality seems very good  although they are thinner than i thought they would be (they seemed like they would be thick and stiff to me based on the photos). ---------- overall these are very nice. but there is one is
1,The colors  style and fit were great. this dress you could wear on many different occasions. all around great piece to own!
1,"This dress is absolutely lovely. i couldn't leave the store without it  even though it was full price and i have a million dresses. it's just that great. i am 5' 8"" 130 lbs and bought the small"
-1,This is a beautiful top but the xs was literally 4-6 inches too wide. very disappointing! i am thin and tall but this was a maternity top on me. i don't usually wear xxs. it is much more voluminous than it appears in the picture and it is definitely gray and blue not white.
-1,"I so wanted to love this top. i ordered the ""blue""  which is blue and orange. i thought the orange would be brighter  it is not. it is a dull color. also  i'm usually a medium  this top fits fine on my shoulders/bust 34c  but it was huge around the waist  making me look a lot larger. if this top were a bit smaller around the waist  i would keep it  but it is going back."
0,Loved the print on this dress  however the fit wasn't for me.  i feel like it exaggerated my belly  and just overall i didn't feel great in it.  the sleeves were also really big.
0,Dress ran very large in every way. beautiful design  lining and quality material. i should have sized down 2 sizes. item is now sold out.
-1,I really wanted to love this shirt. the snowflake and stripe design is really cute  and the fabric is of nice quality. it's a very loose fit  which i would've been willing to work with  but... as mentioned in previous reviews  the shoulder seam rests in an odd place on your upper arm  and there are little bumps in the fabric on the arms that appear similar to what happens if you leave a shirt on a wire hanger too long. it looks like you have nubby little wings coming out of your arms. not attrac
1,I agree with the other reviewer  this skirt is has beautiful print combed cotton with a sheen. it is kind of stiff with a little give  a perfect a line. the waist is a little tight so i sized up  usually wear a 2 and the 4 was perfect for me. wore it to a show last night and was super comfortable and pretty all in one.
-1,This dress looks cute online  but it is enormous. i bought a small  but it looked more like a 3x plus size. i tried it on  just in case  and honestly it looked like a great dress for a clown. this dress must have had two feet of fabric pinned behind the model in the photo.
-1,To be clear i am not built like your models but the biggest problem was the way in which it tented out from the bustline down
1,"Runs large in arm holes. have to wear bandeau. love this print and flow of dress. loose but still flattering due to arms and shoulders . love the overall look. midi length for this 5'6.5"" gal. size s worked best -36c-125lbs"
-1,These pants look beautiful when you first see them. it goes downhill from there. the waist is very small in relation to the rest of the pants. it felt fine when pulled up  but it is a struggle. i could get past that  but when i looked in the mirror  i could see right through them. no lining and not very thick material for this price!!! a real bummer  especially since it was a birthday gift.
0,This sweater is thicker and darker than it appears online. i thought it would be more of a blush color  but it's more dark gray and brown. it wasn't that flattering on me as a cardigan. looked a little cuter all buttoned up  but ultimately i am not keeping because of the color.
-1,"This top looks so pretty on the model. however  the photo is deceiving as the bottom section is quite wide and loose. i am petite but between a c+ to d cup. the top is not really fitted  so my bust pushed the top out and made it look like a maternity piece. from the side it hung way in front of my body. i am wondering if this is clipped in the back on the model. if you are smaller chested and taller  this top might look nice on you. i am 5'1""  105 lbs and c-d cup. i really loved the fabric and c"
-1,I'll start by saying  over the years  i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer's products. this dress represents all of my frustration. cheap  cheap cheap material. low thread count. elastic!!! around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm. i mean  this dress is a total disaster - and looks nothing like the photograph shown.
0,I'm so disappointed with the fit of this top. it is extremely short  even for my 5'2 frame. sizing up will not fix the length. too bad  because the shirt is cute.
0,I really liked the color and style of this dress  but the proportions were off. the top was too small and the waist was too large. if you are more uniform in size/shape and less of an hourglass this dress may be perfect for you!
-1,I like the color blocking of this top  but it was too large and billowy on the bottom. it felt like a pregnancy top so i had to return it as it gave me no shape.
1,This piece is gorgeous in person. it is more of a broen than taupe and goes with everything... it is more of a coat than a sweater. i bought one for my mom  and picked one up for myself when it went on sale. it is moms favorite piece among her extensive retailer collection.
-1,This looked beautiful online  but the skirt isn't 100% silk - the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels  with most of them containing some level of polyester. parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch  and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap. overall very disappointing - this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online.  a definite return. i wouldn't even recommend this at first or second cut.
0,I love these pants. like  obsessively love  like didn't want to take them off to wash them  love. annnnd i wish i hadn't because they came out of a delicate cycle cold water wash with a huge part of the leg seam ripped apart like a spider web. maybe i just got a bad pair  but i wasn't prepared to have to patch them after one wash for the price.
0,The sleeves are a bit too voluminous and the solid color collar stands out a bit too much.  but it's a cute pattern and style.  very comfortable.
-1,This shirt was great for one wear. after just one wash (followed instructions to dry clean) it lost all shape and now hangs like a bed sheet. terrible waste of money on a pricey top.
-1,This skirt was horrible on me. it was loose in the waist  tight in the hips and poofed out like crazy at the tiered part on the bottom. the material also felt cheap and clingy. i guess the fit is tts  but it's hard to tell given how strange the cut was.
1,I picked these up the other day looking for a good jeans alternative. i love them. they are the perfect fit of slim but not skinny. i went with my normal size (26) and so far after one wear  they are still in good shape. a little bit of stretch  but not too much. the moss color is so crisp and goes with a lot. they will be perfect for transitioning into fall.
0,I love this top because it can be worn on or off the shoulders and looks equally as cute either way  i bought the red color and it is super cheerful and perfect for summer. looks great with faded jeans. i love the poplin fabric  although the stitching quality is shabby and i expect this won't hold up long enough to wear again next summer. for the price i feel like it should be crafted a little bit better. i am narrow shoulder'd and bra size 36 b or c and while a medium might have fit me better o
1,This is a wonderful top! the fabric is soft and comfortable  with a beautiful drape. the pattern is very pretty  the curved hems are very flattering  and the top is versatile. it can be worn with shorts  as shown  or a skirt with a belt or pants. i have pilcro wide leg pants in orange  yellow and green  and this top looked amazing with all of them. a great little find!
1,I wore this sweater last weekend and received so many compliments. not only is this a very pretty style  the poncho is comfortable. i really glad i purchased.
1,I love this skirt. i was happy with the quality of the fabric and style. i originally ordered a small  but returned and exchanged for a medium  which fits great. (i typically wear a size 6-8 in pants). i look forward to wearing this skirt to work this fall.
-1,"I'm assuming the model showing the sweater is at least 5'9""  it is slightly cropped on her   but it certainly doesn't look super cropped. i'm 5'4"" and its super cropped on me. even with high waist jeans.  also  it is incredibly itchy. i even tried it with a cami under but the itchy wool came right through the cami.  too bad  its a cute design  just needs some tweaking."
0,I love the way this top looks in the picture and the embroidery is as lovely as it appears--very detailed. it is both subtle (not cheap looking) and special.    as an earlier reviewer noted  the top is not see-through  a plus.    the drawbacks  though  mean that i will be returning this top.     1. the fabric is very heavy and does not drape well. i am a small woman with a large chest and ordered a size 0. the top is still loose  even in that size  and the relative stiffness of the fabric gives
1,Super cute jacket .perfect for fall i can't stop wearing it
0,"I love the maeve line and was excited to get this dress. unfortunately  the fit was just bad. the top fit fine but the bottom half was too snug and there were unattractive gaps around the waist and the pockets. don't think another size or tailoring would address the issue. for size  i am 5'4""  130 and ordered the 6."
-1,Seems there was a design defect in this item--sleeves are way too tight and hardly go on without ripping the shirt. i have pretty thin arms so it's hard to imagine this not happening on anyone. too bad because it's otherwise a very nice top.
0,I purchased the grey in a medium  i normally wear an 8 or 10 in tops  36 c.. i found it to fit quite well  but it has the shape that seems common at retailer lately in that it is shorter and more boxy. so if you have a longer torso(like me)  you may not be the happiest. i loved the lace and didn't have an issue with that area being sheer  but the non-lace part is very thin. i did try it on with a black bra and it was obvious i was wearing black all around  you could even see the width of th
0,True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso. very unflattering cut!
1,Overall this is a great shirt. the material is soft and a little sheer  but not sheer enough to have to wear something underneath. the only negative is that the v sits a little high so i felt like i was constantly pulling the shirt down through out the day.
-1,So after reading the 2 reviews  decided to just order my usual size (26)  thinking they might be a tad snug. wrong! they were huge! i looked at the size to see if they sent me a size 30 by mistake! unfortunately small sizes sold out. quality is excellent as well as style  so bummed!
0,I am a huge pilcro fan. however  these were beyond large. i am not even sure that the next size down would work. keep this in mind if you attempt these pants.
1,Really cute tee... charcoal is deep and great all seasons. cut high on sides... may need to size up to accommodate - depends on body shape. tried the white  didn't buy--- too lightweight  but could work layered.
0,Unfortunately this piece has a very boxy cut and the white layer is stiff and billows out - i am tall and thin but this made me look pregnant - very unflattering. i considered trying a smaller size  but i did not like the material too much either so i just returned it.
1,It pills a little under the arms and picks up lint  but it's totally worth it. this is a fabulous sweater coat. i receive compliments on it wherever i go. so cozy  warm & delicious. not too hot to wear indoors either. it's breathable. love it. bought in green during black friday sale. highly recommend.
0,"I love jumpsuits and was excited about this one because i liked the print/colors and that it's long-sleeved. i ordered my usual medium size (i'm a solid medium). it was a tad tight in the rear/thigh area (not flattering when you have a thin material which shows every bump unlike jeans) but the length (i'm 5'5"") and top fit well. i returned it and ordered the large but the waist was huge (and that's coming from a person with a bit of a tummy bulge) and there isn't anything to cinch the waist in."
1,Love this jacket!got my usual size medium and is perfect! beautiful quality
1,"I just received this shirt in the mail  and i'm in love. it isn't your average t-shirt in that it has character and class. i can't wait to wear it! another reviewer was unhappy that the embroidery in blue on the back wasn't as dramatic as the picture; i'm not seeing it. i think the blue stands out very well. i know i should say  ""hurry and get yours before they're gone "" but in truth  i'd rather be the only one with this beautiful shirt! :)"
0,I  absolutely fell in love with the stress when i sought in the store. the fabric and drape of the fabric is amazing! however  it runs extremely small. i normally wear a medium and can sometimes even wear a small and dresses. i tried on the medium and the large and i could not even get them zipped all the way.  i'm so disappointed  as this is a gorgeous dress.  definitely size up at least one  maybe two sizes.
0,"5'7""  34c  28 jeans  size 4 dress. fell in love with the pattern in particular  knowing the design might not work best for my body. ordered the size small - it was not unflattering - but it did nothing for my body type. if anything  the excess fabric made me appear wider and made my waist non-existent. the trouble was that the skirt portion has the elastic band starting high - approximately right under your chest - almost like an empire waist (this is hidden by the flap of material hanging over"
0,When i first opened this dress and tried it on i thought it was adorable. it is very flattering on my hourglass figure and hides my recent baby weight. the problem is the hem. it was already rolling up when i took it out of the package  and i should have noticed and returned it  but i figured the problem would be easily solved by a good ironing. well  it wasn't  and it gets worse every time i wash the dress. it's like the hem isn't constructed properly.
-1,Such a cute skirt- but impossible to get on. ordered in an xs (i have a 25/26 waist) but could barely get it past my knees to step into. if you have any hips at all  unfortunately this skirt won't work. i was tempted to size up but once i got it on it fit great in the waist and already had too much material to size up to a small.
1,These jeans! i am obsessed. the perfect boyfriend fit with an easy  relaxed feel. i feel instantly cooler when i slip into these. do yourself a favor and buy them!!
1,This blouse is pretty sheer  but perfect for a summer day. good coverage in the front and under arms on the sides for limited bra exposure  and a very cute opening in on the lower back.
