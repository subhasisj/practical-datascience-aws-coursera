1,Love this blouse in yellow! fit is true to size  and it looks a feels great.
0,The cut and print of this dress is beautiful. however  the armhole is way too low  which is a reoccurring problem with anything sleeveless from retailer these days. please don't drop the armholes so low  most women do not want their bra completely showing every time you lift your arm!
1,"This is the most beautiful dress ever! i'm very short and petite with an hourglass figure and a rather large chest. this dress feels like it was made for me. i often have a difficult time finding a dress that flatters my figure and is slimming. i was shocked that it was even a little roomy in the chest. the cut is so beautiful and it is very well made. while the lining might be too short for tall girls  being only 5""1  the lining is perfect. the length in the back is just a teeny bit too long so"
-1,It's a rather boring tank. i thought it'd be perfect under a cardigan for work  but decided against it. the fit is boxy  and does not look good on a girl with curves.
1,This is such a cute top. perfect for fall layered with a sweater!
-1,This skirt is definitely not what i was expecting. the material is stiff and rough. the skirt is also loud. you can hear it swishing when you move  and not in a classy way. it feels like you're wearing a very long tutu. also  the pattern isn't quite as pretty in person. they must have used magic in order to make this skirt look flowy in the photos - it does not flow.
0,I liked the concept of this vest  but when i tried it on  i felt like i was 9 years old again and wearing my brownies girl scout uniform. it was also very boxy and wide. it seemed to be well-made  though  and maybe would have worked if it were a different color.
1,"I had been eyeing the maroon one and i snatched it as soon as it went on sale. when i pulled it out of the package  i could not believe how soft it was. literally  as a cloud. think of the softest  fluffiest baby blanket. also  the cut is extremely flattering. i am 5'7""  135 lb and the medium fit me perfectly  flowing  but not boxy. love it!"
0,This shirt fit really really big! i ordered an xl but think i could get away with a l  if not a medium. sadly  it's going back :( otherwise  it's high quality and a beautiful design.
0,I ordered this pants in white and black. i read the reviews and weren't that bad. i am 5'6 and 125 lbs. i got them in size small. they are way too big. the small size seems to be xl and they are way too long for someone who is maybe 5'8 or 5'9. i have to returned them. quality is ok looking on my opinion.
-1,Really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews  even with the sale price and addtl discount. it's basically $30 blouse fabric with design and detail-work of a much more expensive blouse. the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily. if it were black  you could probably get away with it  but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle. sad to have to send it back.
-1,The back of this t-shirt looks cute but the front looks really weird. the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft  so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy. i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front. it fits true to size.
-1,I loved how soft this dress was  as well as versatile. however  i only got to wear it one time because after the first wash  a giant fabric tear happened on one of the seams. unfortunately  the fabric is so soft  but rather thin  and it didn't hold. the care instructions say machine washable but i wouldn't put it in the washing machine again. especially since i often have to wash clothes twice in the washer i use because it's so old and barely agitates. would love this if it was made a little be
-1,This is a beautiful dress. the quality is excellent. the 3 layers and the embroidery are beautiful... however it just didn't look right on me. it looked like a maternity dress. i am very petite  short with a big bust and it just did nothing for me. i think this style would look best on a tall woman with a smaller bust. unfortunately i will be returning this dress.
-1,"I cannot imagine this dress working in any size. i am a small  thin and average height woman (usually a 25/26 in pants  a size 32c bust  and 5'6"" tall). this dress was huge. i sized down to a 2 ( i am always a 4 in dresses) and this dress was still big... i do not know if i could size down to a 0 though as the shoulders seemed to fit right. it was ginormous. i got it for a wedding in two months and i will be 3 months pregnant  it still wouldn't work unless i was 9 months pregnant and carrying tr"
0,This is a beautiful dress. all that's missing is a bonnet!
1,Beautiful top! the body flows nicely and the colors are wonderfully vivid. it goes with everything and looks great for work or going out. my only gripe is the sleeves are really tight. i struggle a little to get on and off but once on it looks awesome.
0,This is a bit more jacket-ish than i expected. the material is kind of scratchy  and it was heavier than expected. it has a lining in it  like a jacket lining. i wasn't a fan of the clasps on the front. i guess they are meant to be invisible  but they are literally little metal clasps. it is more cropped in the length than i expected  and i don't have a particularly long torso. i like the embroidery. the pattern is lovely. the fit is about spot on. i am about a 12/14 with a 38c bust and the l fi
-1,I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn't it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can't really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that
-1,"Like other reviewers  i saw this dress on the cover of the catalog and knew i had to have it! well  i am very disappointed. the colors aren't as rich as the outdoor photo  although they're brighter than shown in the studio photos. this is just not a flattering dress. i've put it on three times and taken it back off. the neck is too high  the sleeves are too narrow (and i have really skinny arms)  and there's no ""swing"" to it. i am 5'4"" and weigh 120 pounds and bought a size small  which is what"
0,This dress is cute and i will wear it to work. i only decided to keep it because i got the sale price and an additional 40 percent off. the print is cute  but a little bit odd  it's a swimmer in a cap. the tie is fun.
-1,This top is well made and would be cute but huge. this top has no shape and is way big. back this goes.j
-1,Ordered this in white and the peachy color- the armholes were gaping. not well designed. i don't recommend this tee at all.
1,I bought this dress for summer celebrations. the fabric is beautiful and the colors are soft and enhance the flow of the dress. the fit is true to size and i especially like that it is not too low cut in the front. i will pair it with a light sweater or denim jacket. definitely a dress than can be dressed up or down. very feminine and has a romantic feel.
0,This dress is really cute in person. however  it did not fit me like it does the model in the pic at all. first of all i'm 5 feet 1 and it was wayyy too short on me. i didn't have the petit on either-- i had the regular xs. it just hits a couple of inches too short for me. i am 50. it would be adorable if i were more comfortable in shorter dresses. i wear short things a lot  but this was just too high on me. it was probably a good 8 inches above my knee. also it flared too dramatically at the wa
1,Love the length  color  and rise. new favorite jeans! they're a little loose around the ankle and the way they hang is the only thing i don't like.
1,This dress is gorgeous. i bought it to wear to the ballet  and i know i will wear it to other formal events as well. it is really fancy---definitely wouldn't wear it to work! i had it hemmed as it was really long on me  and it is a bit tight in the shoulders. it has a beautiful shape and flows while you are walking---it felt pretty!
1,Great as a beach coverup. i paired it with a slip underneath and a belt and it looks amazing! can't wait to wear it on the beaches of the bahamas soon!
-1,This top doesn't at all fit like it does on the model. the mid section is very wide and boxy and the material is thick and almost sweatshirt-like. i typically wear size small or 4  but perhaps an xs might've fit or looked better. sadly i must return this shirt.
1,Highly recommend these jeans! they are ultra-soft and fit your body like a dream. the wash is flattering on them as well. i was looking for a pair of jeans to be my go to and ultimately landed on these. they do runa little big but they do not stretch out much so i went with my usual size.
0,I am on the fence about this one. the length is great. it hits right above my knee at 5'1. overall it was larger than i was hoping. the waist is pretty loose  and i really had to tightly tie the back to get s good shoulder fit. the bottom is very voluminous making me look wide. i wish they had it in a petite size. for this price  i will probably return it. it's not worth the 300 price tag.
-1,This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster.
0,This is soooo much more cropped than it looks in the picture. the fabric is super soft and design is cute. i really wanted to like this  but it just doesn't fit as shown. the back is halfway up by back and i am shortwaisted...
0,I purchased this dress online and it just didn't fit my body very well. it also arrived with a pretty sizeable hole so i can't say that i'm impressed with the quality. there were other areas too where was a loose thread which i'm sure will develop into another hole eventually. returned.
1,I ordered this cutie before i read any reviews and i am so glad i did. mine does not have any weird smell at all. i ordered a medium and i wear a size 8. it fits perfectly and is long enough to wear with leggings ...with coverage. the detailing on the yoke is so pretty. i bought it with a discount promotion so it made the price better. i am really glad to add it to my wardrobe!!
0,Great colors and not too voluminous. lined whig will be great for fall but the downsides are the huge elastic waist bc it'll require a belt or something over it (looks v casual alone) and even with a perfect fit it gives a bit of muffin just bc it's a huge piece of elastic. i've literally tried this on on two occasions trying to convince myself it it. lol but it's not worth it at the current price.
-1,I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light  the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.
0,I love this sweater  so why a lower rating? while i love the material and the color  it lost all of its shape before i even left the house! i am a size 6 / small and it looked clownish on me before i ever got to my dinner party.  i plan to wash it this evening and i really hope that this brings it back to its original shape and keeps it.
-1,"I'm so disappointed this dress didn't work out! i ordered the size medium  post baby i'm a solid dress size 6 or 8 depending on the designer.  the cashier was laughing with me how ridiculously huge this garment was when i held it up.     also the length was super long  description says 35"" which would be mid thigh for me  but this thing hit me mid knee. also  like the previous review the shoulders are tented and poofy. so bizarre and the cut reminds me of a maternity dress  but the shoulders def"
0,I wanted to love this top. the color is wonderful in the pink and the material is silky soft. it is huge though  i am a 34 dd and bought my usual small! i am going to exchange for an xs and am hoping it fits.
1,This is now one of my favorite retailer button downs. it's super soft and super flattering. it's everything you'd want this cute shirt to be!
0,I love the front of this shirt but i really should have paid more attention to the details of it. i would have realized the front and back are different materials  which i am not a fan of. i would have preferred the entire thing was made of the dressier front material instead of the jersey back. it's like a mullet  business in the front and party in the back. it's got great drape and is a beautiful blue though  so into rotation it goes.
0,For reference: 5'3  130#  athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders  slim hips)  i ordered the small and i was absolutely swimming in it. perhaps the petite would have been better  but there was just too much fabric everywhere. the sleeves were ridiculous on me  and even cinching the waist with a belt just wouldn't have slimmed the silhouette for me. i have muscular shoulders  and 34d chest  so the top fit as it should  just everything became way too much elsewhere. the fabric was soft and sw
-1,I am short and curvy and this shirt swallowed me. sleeves were especially long.
0,Read all the reviews i didn't really understand that it really had real shape wear in the skirt. i live in florida and found the dress to be too confining and hot. i would never get any wear out of it. much better for someone up north. had to return it.
0,This is a beautiful fabric and the skirt is so nice. what is wrong is the cut of the skirt. one side bells out more than the other  giving it an off center look from the front. my legs were not centered.
1,Casual  pretty. runs a little large  especially through the waist  but a great comfortable shirt.
1,I am normally a size 4/6p in all things retailer but read the reviews and opted to go petite on the maxi and size up. i went with the 8p and even with a 32d bust  had no trouble zipping and it fit beautifully. the band is a tad loose  but any tighter wouldn't have fit in the bust. this dress hangs beautifully and is incredibly flattering  especially for those of us with an athletic build.
1,I really feel in love with the details of these joggers and they did not fail me when they arrived. i haven't worn them yet but tried them on and they seem like nice little relaxed wear with a tee shirt. i can see them being worn with a cami in warm weather or a relaxed tee shirt in a variety of colors. all in all   very versatile   and i recommend them.
1,"I bought this top about 3 weeks ago& love it! i like it because it's better than a plain t-shirt so it's perfect for running around doing errands or shopping. i like the material and the length  i'm 5'8"" and sometimes i feel like shirts are to short. i wash it and hang it to dry  no shrinking or pilling so far! i am ordering this in at least two more colors!"
-1,"The color is nice and the material is what you might find used by a high school drama club with a low budget - a very cheap polyester. on top of that - it is unhemmed and unfinished in any way - so you can bet  that about the second or third wearing there are going to be runs all through the thing. i've attached a picture of the ""hem"" below. on top of that - the ruching is awkward (as mentioned by another reviewers). all in all - kind of terrible."
0,I so badly wanted this top to work. it looks so cute! but  as soon as i tried it on  i knew it wasn't a keeper. i didn't even need a mirror! it's not suited for those of us with a bust (i'm a 34d) and anything but a lanky model-esque frame. i suggest sizing up if you're busty and want to give it a try. it looked dowdy on me.
-1,I usually love tops like this  i bought this is the store because if was so soft. got it home and was so disappointed because it is not very flattering at all.would be a great house top though because it is soft enough to sleep in.
1,I ordered this on a whim and am so glad that i did. it's a great color shirt and the embroidery is perfect. i like the length of the shirt.
1,"I love these pants! for reference i am 5'1 1/2"" and 104lbs. so definitely petite. i ordered the extra small petite- way too long and huge around the hips.- i checked to see if maybe they sent the wrong size. hemming would not have been a problem and i even considered having them altered - but it would have been too difficult with the pockets and the pleats. unfortunately they do not come in xxs p so sadly they are going back. order a size down."
0,I really like the pilcro serif style but the stet style does not work for my body. will have to return.
-1,"I've been buying from retailer for the last 15 years and this is the first time i've ever posted a bad review. first of all the fabric is scratchy  thin  and looks very cheap. second of all there is no v back  it's more of a slight scoop. and lastly i'm 5'3"" so i ordered the petite small and it's still comes 4 inches below my knee. i am very disappointed in the quality and am definitely sending back. the only thing i think this could possible good for is a swim coverup."
0,Overall construction/craftmanship of skirt is poor- the dots were sewn in on the seam- some dots didn't lay flat on side by seam- looked like some dots were missing around the top part of skirt in back- ( very disappointed in the quality from retailer- my last 3 or so orders have been similar complaints with their items- sad!!!)
0,But i didn't like the fit. maybe because i ordered petite and the length threw me off  but they weren't flattering in any way. the color and material were unique and pleasing. had to send them back though.
-1,I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly  no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands  bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short  but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them  they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer  plus a delicate cycle  no dryer. the lace is man
-1,"This is a pretty dress  but the cut is quite boxy. i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then ""flare out"" more around the waist down to the hem; however  the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down  which lends to a rather unflattering look."
-1,This top runs huge. not only in the torso/chest area but the sleeves on this were enormous and the shoulder area was very puffy. i am normally between a m-l but would have to get a small or extra small to make it work.
1,I consider myself fairly busty (34 d)  but i didn't have any problems wearing my normal size small/medium.....i actually went with the small. the lace inset doesn't give  but it wasn't tight at all. i love the flow of the blouse....it is going to be a great transitional piece into fall!
1,This is a wonderful vest! i love the lining!! keeps you nice and warm! i love the muted green color! the pockets are sewn closed but can be cut open at the stitching without ruining the vest!!
0,I love the colors in this top  but sadly i'm going to have to return it. the first thing my husband did when he saw this on me was just stare  and not in a good way. then he said it looked like a maternity top. i was so disappointed  and sadly will be returning this. for reference  i am 135 pounds. 5-ft. 4-in tall and do not want to look pregnant in a top. i normally wear size medium tops  but this one is huge. now i know why the model in the picture had her arms nestled in at her sides. this to
1,Love this shirt! it runs a bit big  i ordered the (petite) 4 and its a bit long in the sleeves if i don't roll them up  and a bit long and big in the back. but i love the look and it is classic. great with skinny jeans.
-1,I was excited to see this top  ordered it and was disappointed. it was too tight across the chest and had too much fabric around the bottom. i tried this on 3 times hoping for i had been wrong in previous assessments- no luck.
-1,I was extremely disappointed when this arrived. it's nothing like the red color shown  rather it's a very dull reddish color. as other reviews have suggested  it is very thin and runs large. i have to return.
1,Love this coat - great fall piece! i bought the green color and it looks as shown in the picture. great retailer purchase!
1,I also agree that this piece ran very small. my normal size did not zip up. i sized up a size  and it pulled across my thighs. i sized up two sizes  and it fit as i had hoped it would. if you get the right size  it is beautiful on. the colors are so fun  and i love the side slit. i bought it to wear to work with a blouse or blazer  and it is definitely a statement piece.
1,So stunning  i had to have it for my spring wardrobe! fits true to size and fits well in the bust and is looser on the bottom. the model weara it just as it fits on me. if you have a large bust you may need to size up as the fabric isn't stretchy.
