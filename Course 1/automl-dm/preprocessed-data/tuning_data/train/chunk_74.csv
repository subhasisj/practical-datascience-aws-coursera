0,"I finally ordered this at this incredible mark downed price...but i see why. it is cute  but serious size issues  i have a bust but smaller everywhere else but i did order up because of it being a jumpsuit...i would have needed 6"" more to even zip the top part! i have many trendy jumpsuits in my closet and this is a first! if you are flat chested you may want to try at this great price as it would be a great piece for sitting by the fireside next fall/winter...never too soon to plan ahead!"
-1,I ordered this top on line. i wanted to love it  but unfortunately the fit was not for me. i am 5'9 with a long torso. this top was cut very wide and looks like a maternity top.
0,I sized down one size and it's still too big with the double v-neck style. this is going back.
0,This sweater is big and box. it looks very similar on as it does on the model. as other reviewers have mentioned  the embroidery on the shoulders is a bit itchy.
-1,First  the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer. i really wanted to like this top  but the fitting is so awkward for me. i typically where a 0/xs  and sized up in the shirt to a size 2. it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest (size 32/a). i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow (need a strapless bra) and made it look unflattering overall. had to return this one back to the store.
-1,I was so so excited to get this sweater in the mail. unfortunately  the sweater is lined with the same material (very soft and warm btw) as the polka dots  which sheds like crazy. i wore a white tshirt under this for the first time  and my shirt was covered in black fuzz by the end of the day. so much so that i was gathering balls of it to be thrown away. very disappointed. a lint roller can't even clean up the tshirt.  in terms of sizing  this fits tts  i normally wear a l or xl  got this in an
0,I loved the romantic look of this robe and gown set  but the material was very thin and wrinkled and needs to be ironed. the m/l was uncomfortable and i normally wear only a m. sadly  i returned the set.
0,I so wanted to keep this sweater but the invisible metallic threads that give the sweater its crinkled appearance are super scratchy and irritating. it definitely requires a long sleeved top to prevent the irritation as shown in the online photo. it is lightweight and i planned to wear it over sleeveless summer tops/dresses. i have averaged size arms and there was plenty of upper arm room. in fact extra room is designed into the sleeves. one plus for those with upper arm fit concerns. the lower
1,This top is very pretty and looks expensive and as pictured  nice pattern and could be dressed up or down  the gathered neck is beautiful and has a bit if a stretch   however  the back of the top has strange bat wing-like design element that seem unnecessary and distract from the elegance of the rest if the top  sadly  i think i may send it back.
-1,I bought this dress to wear to an out of state wedding. first time wearing  when i tied the strap  the pull through at the top of the halter broke with minimal stress. i sewed it back with a repair kit from the hotel but was worried the whole night the dress would not hold up. if this is all that is holding the dress on  it should be more secure with reinforced stitching. beautiful material and comfortable.
-1,I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it  although probably comfortable  not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture  in person.
1,"I was so excited to see that these were on sale post holidays. love the style and the fit. my only disappointment was that they don't have as much stretch as i thought they would (i wrote above that it ""runs small"" but if it had more stretch then the sizing would be ok). for reference i'm 5'5 and 10. i usually wear 25 in pilcro pants but these felt tighter. i would exchange for a 26 but they're sold out unfortunately!"
-1,I bought this online. this looked like a sweater that was accidentally shrunk in the dryer  when i received it.    i will be returning this.
-1,I ordered this dress is in the yellow/orange. the colors are pretty  the pink detail is nice and that's about it. the slip underneath is a form fitting yellow cotton - no big deal. the dress itself runs very large and in an unflattering way. if i was pregnant  it was perfect. the material feels cheap to me and this  along with the roomy fit - is why this dress will be returned.
0,I really wanted to keep this dress  and the material is amazing  so soft and gentle and delicate  the design is great  the front looks nice  but from back looks really awkward  big and kind of too loose!
1,Ordered two of these and they fit great and will be perfect for layering.  true to size fit.  cute detail in the back for a racer tank!
0,Totally pretty but not crazy flattering. a bit wide in the hip area if you are not tall. good on sale but i wouldn't pay full price.
-1,This coat is beautiful in color and design. we could have been great friends but it was waaay too big so i had to return it. i bought the smallest size possible yet i could have been 9 months pregnant and still would have had room to spare. i also was disappointed that the sleeves were not lined like other coats in this price range.
1,I've been looking for dresses to wear to nurse in since i just had a baby & so i bought this dress knowing it just had a tack holding the front fold together & always intending to remove the tack. i love it. the fabric is super soft. i wear it with a nursing tank underneath and a wide belt to cinch my waist & it's amazing. with the tack in  it did pull very strangely across the bust as others have mentioned  so it's not good for a big bust unless you intend to remove the tack & wear something un
0,"Lovely jeans  love the details in the cuff bottoms. the front of the jeans  the relaxed ""boyfriend"" part was just too relaxed for me - too much material there that it was unflattering. otherwise cute."
1,This tank is perfect for summer since it pairs so nicely with shorts! jeans work well  too  and during cooler seasons  i can wear a cardigan over it to stay warm.    the fit of this top is not true to size  for it runs large  but is flattering on the body nonetheless. the stripes and miniature circular openings  i noticed  add beautiful detail for formal or informal events.    as a whole  this shirt is perfect! the one aspect of this top that may need to be carefully attended to is the material
0,I tried this on in the store  and the fabric is lovely - so  so soft and drapey. the skirt is very flattering - good length. but the zipper! the zipper was already ripped away from the fabric  so i wasn't able to purchase it. such a shame.
-1,This top looks beautiful online. when i got it  it looks nothing like the pic. it's wide  too much fabric  no shape and so unflattering. it's definitely going back
0,I have been searching high and low for some good quality jeans. sadly i don't think these are it. i love the design and style of these jeans. great length  great cut  great color unfortunately in the 3 weeks that i have had them they are balling and looking like i've had them for 3 years. i'm so disappointed. and will have to continue on my search. apparently they don't make jeans like they used too?
0,I bought this because i loved it online but in person there is another level to the shirt that i did notice in another picture. i didn't like the second level on me since i am a shorter person. just didn't fit my body quite right.
1,I got this on sale. i sized up from my normal 10 to a 12 based on reviews. the 12 is too large for me and i'd need a 10 which is sold out. the straps are very long. i think even if i sized down  i'd have to have them altered. also  the dress i got is missing the bottom button. sending back. i'm not too sad  i ordered the pink pippa swing dress with the same order and love it.
-1,"I was so bummed by this dress! i had high hopes when i ordered it  but was surprised by the poor quality and cheap materials when it arrived. the body of the dress is unlined fleece material -- it reminded me of material that they make cheap halloween costumes out of. i found the fit baggy and unflattering.  the ""shawl"" portion is only attached at the very top of the shoulders   very disappointed. i already returned this."
-1,"This is a really nice quality dress. it is a low-cut v-neck but the fabric is form fitting so its not revealing when u move. i love the top part of the dress but the skirt just did nothing for me. it's a soft material but the skirt almost resembles a bath towel in look and feel. i am petite in size (5'0"" 100lbs). i will be returning due to the skirt being to loose on me in width rather than length. also  the center pleat of the skirt makes it look a bit odd. the skirt hit right at knee height."
-1,"This dress is just too baggy overall. i am 5'6"" 140 lbs and a size small was so unflattering. i can't go down in size because the waist detail will get too high on me. it was already a little high on the small."
0,This shirt was strange. the bow tie was too thin and the dots were too dominant on the shirt. it looks okay in the model picture  but when i tried it on the bow and the dots just clashed.
1,These were as great in person as i had hoped; great color for fall  super comfy and flattering fit. happy with my purchase!
1,I saw this tee and was unsure about the print  but decided to give it a try. i'm glad i did  as it has become a weekend staple.
1,I am so glad i read the reviews for this before i purchased it. i am 5'5 and 135 pounds and normally wear a size 6 in dresses. i would normally buy a small  but sized down to an xs and it was perfect! it's a beautiful dress and very flattering!
0,"Bought a pair of the gray and loved them  but after i washed them i saw the color was distorted as if bleach from a previous wash was still in the machine.     so i ordered a second pair this one in green - same thing happened after i washed it. looked at instructions (finally!) and it says to wash in cold water - i washed in warm. could that be the problem?     anyway - now they both look like there's discoloration and not a ""washed look"" that's on purpose.     i'll still wear them  but an expe"
-1,This is way cuter on the model. it runs so big that it is very unflattering. perhaps on someone tall it would look better  but sadly it looked dumpy on my 5'2 frame. it also arrived with some black stain on it. it is going back.
1,"I own quite a few deletta tops  and this one nails it. a great staple in a pretty color (i purchased the green). peplum tops can be hit or miss for me and often come up short or balloon out too much. this one is so flattering. i initially ordered a medium (5'8""  145) but exchanged for a small when i found the medium to be a little roomy on me. the small is perfect. the top is made of a medium weight material and is slightly fitted  nipping in at the waist. the ""skirt"" piece falls nicely and is l"
0,The shape was not as nice on model  seemed like a lot of extra material.
1,The print caught my eye. then i felt the breathable cotton fabric and had to try it on. i am only 5'2'' and have a small waist but sized 32dd bust with hips and have a hard time finding clothes that fit well.. this dress fit me perfectly! i have dressed it up and down and always get compliments. this dress was on the pricey side but has turned out to be worth every penny.
-1,The print and fabric are great  but this dress has odd construction  or maybe i have an odd construction. anyway  i'm 5-5  weigh 125-130  36d. i ordered the small and it fit perfect up top and in the arms - but the issue was in the hips. i'm somewhere between athletic and curvy. the skirt looks more a-line in the photo  but it's actually cut pretty straight. spanx would have helped  but i'm not about to wear spanx all day in a work/casual dress  i think a medium would make the top too big  so i
-1,This sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off. it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it. it was uneven and stretched out. it looked like it was not well made to me. it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz. i returned this one.
0,As with many of retailer's tops these days  there is a lot of fabric on this tee. it hangs fairly well  though. the white color is cream  which didn't work for me but isn't bad. a little sheer but wearable with a nude bra. if you have a thinnish upper body  order down a size!
1,This blazer is really well made  it has a nice weight and stretch to it. i think it might run a bit on the large size  i am sometimes a small and sometimes an xs and the xs is perfect. it's a great blazer to throw on to cinch together a casual yet put together look. i don't think the picture here does it justice. it will be getting a ton of wear in my work wardrobe. i love it!
1,Since there isn't one where i live  i ran into retailer while waiting for my daughter to pick me up. saw this and bought it off the rack w/out trying on. had to get a m as they were out of s  and yes  it's a tad large on me  but still glad i got it. i think it will be a nice transition piece into fall in hot texas. love how the linen drapes and it makes me feel a bit more dressed up than a cotton tee. the ruching on the sleeves is an extra nice touch.
1,A truly gorgeous dress. ran a little too small in the shoulders for me so i had to reorder the next size up. its is very long  but i won't hesitate to have it altered. it is stunning!
1,A slip underneath makes this dress substantial. it's a good 'weather' transition dress-fall/spring. the lace is very pretty and it's an overall great dress that will take you anywhere. i plan to wear burgundy tights and brown boots with ti next weekend.
-1,There's just nothing special about it. it runs small and the fabric is itchy. the design with button caught my eye  but i didn't like it well enough to keep it.
0,Love the idea of this but it ran short and boxier than i would have liked. material is soft  cute design but not flattering. returning
0,It seems like most people love this tee  so you might as well. i returned it because i didn't like how the front hung. if the front was as long as the back  i would have kept it. or  if the front was short enough to wear with thick pants  untucked  i might have kept it (seems like this top would only look good with leggings or skirts). i do like the material  though. it's very thin and looks great in the shoulder and neck area. and i liked how the back of the shirt looked when i tried wearing it
-1,I was so excited to get this dress...i even paid expedited shipping! i read the reviews and thought that i ordered properly but i sadly disappointed. it was just too big. i'm a size 6-8 petite and the size 8 was overwhelming. the side of the dress were down to my stomach and i just can't wear the dress. not sure what to do but buyers be careful. pretty color and design but not well-designed.
1,I love the tiger print. its subtlety is the perfect added quirk to an outfit.
1,"Recently bought these on sale  though they were still a bit in the expensive side. i'm 5'2"" and typically a size 4  the xs fits perfectly. the pants fall to my ankle and are not cropped as they are on the model  but i'm fine with that. the piping on the seams helps them not seem too much like pajamas  and i was particularly pleased that the crotch was not too baggy  as sometimes happens with this style."
0,I am very into the lace tops! purchased this but it's a very exaggerated swing top and on someone who is 5'3  it feels almost like a tunic. lots of extra material in the back. love the look and if you're tall enough  it should work for you!
0,Although the fabric and color is beautiful   the sleeves do not lay properly. they are too stiff and look like wings on me. sadly i must return. the quality looks great. it is unfortunate that the design was a miss.
-1,Why is it so difficult to find a shirt that doesn't expose half of my bra if i lift my arm?     this is cute (beyond the arm hole issue) but overpriced. going back.
1,"I love the length of this top and i love tops that don't cling in the tummy area. it fits well and the crochet detailing is nice. for reference  i'm 5'.4.5""  150 lbs  34dd and the m fit me well. since i'll be wearing this with leggings mostly during colder months  this top is a little bright and the material is not meant for cold days. since i live in texas  i can get away wearing it even in colder months."
0,I thought the quality of the fabric was good and liked the idea of wearing it  either with opening in front or back. it was a little larger then i was expecting and i wish it had a closure  (hook and eye or snap) at the top. it has three places in the back to tie together and when i tied them in a bow they came loose easily. overall glad i bought it.
-1,Awful color  horribly wrinkled and just a mess...so disappointed
-1,I ordered the white and the light blue in size xl. both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses. everything the first reviewer wrote is true. the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain (like the blue). the back is just a solid  kind of slippery material. it's strange because it's not see-through in the back but you need to wear a tank/cami for the front. so  it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer.     i would
0,I looked like i was going to work on a farm. well made  but seemed fit big. i like and have owned wide leg pants/capris  these were cartoonishly wide.  needless to say  they were returned.
-1,As soon as i pulled these pants from their packaging  i feel in love with them. the fabric was so soft - i could not wait to get them on...yeah  that was not going to happen! i could not pull them on - not even a little bit! these pants run incredibly small. i ordered them twice: once in my regular size  and again in a larger size. unfortunately  i am sized out of these beauties.
1,Love this dress. the fit is amazing. i wore it to church for my brother's wedding and got so many compliments. it looks great in photos too!
1,I purchased this top online  love the off the shoulder trend and this looked like it would be perfect for fall. nice fabric and lace detail but the top definitely runs big! i ordered an xl and it was beyond swimming on me. definitely order a size or two down! also  it is very long / tunic length. i love a tunic but it almost wore more as a dress than a top! overall  cute item and fabric but definitely order down!!
0,"Just received pants and even though they are labeled ""petite"" they are not. the inseam is 28 for a waist size 26  which is not what the description states."
-1,This shirt was so weird?it does not fit like the photo at all. there seems to be missing a stitch or something at the top as it is wide open until the bottom/where it meets the other layer. i could wear a tank/camisole underneath  but it still just did not fit right. i do not have a large chest  but this was ridiculous. beyond that  the red color was just okay. even though i purchased this on sale  it was not worth the price and i returned.
1,Love the leggings. very soft and comfortable. i ordered two pair -one s/m and one m/l. the s/m fit better on me but both will work.
-1,I do not even know where to begin with this product. i ordered a small (i go between small and medium) and felt that would be a good fit. after trying on the shirt  i would have opted for the xxxxxxxxs or whatever the smallest size is. this shirt is very boxy. i know its supposed to have a 'flow' to it  but this shirt is too much. it needs to be taken in. or have a belt wrapped around it. i tried the belt look but it did not look flattering. i found this color to be very blah. overall  i am slig
0,Finally a pretty maeve shirt that actually fit my (apparently) giant hulk arms.. but it's so flowy/swingy i had to return it. this might just be a problem with being a larger lady  but the excess fabric made me feel like i was wearing a tent and made me look 10x bigger than i was around my waist/hips  even when balanced out with leggings. i thought about trying to size down but wasn't sure if that would even solve the excess fabric problem and still leave room in the arms. of course i can't try
1,"I love this sweatshirt. it's super chic and sexy (and for those of us that need actual support  it looks great with a strappy sports bra).  that said  selling this as ""one size fits all"" is misleading  at best.  i'm 5'2  ~160 (a lot of it muscle  but i enjoy chorizo)  a 34ddd  and this fit me perfectly  but i can't imagine it would work for anyone much larger than a size 12.  just be real -- this is a smedium.     one star removed for the ""one size fits all"" fallacy."
1,This sweater is super light-weight and is very cute.
1,I had read all the reviews about the regular length being too long (they were out of stock on the petite when i ordered) but i took a chance and ordered the regular size. i love it! it is a little long in the back  but i think that makes it a little more fun than your standard plaid shirt. so cute with skinny jeans and leggings! it is one of my favorite fall tops! i got the blue but might go back and get the red since it would be so great for the holidays!
