1,"This top is just darling!  the body of the top is lightweight ""sweatshirt"" type material that's dyed to appear well used.  the ruffling along the bottom is color coordinated and beautifully textured.  great to wear with leggings!  the back hangs lower than the front so your rear will be covered.  extremely comfortable  machine washable.  an unexpectedly ""nicer than it looks online"" garment.  i bought the blue version which looks more lavender irl."
1,I really love everything about this cardigan. the detailing at the bottom part of the arms adds a lot  the color is highly versatile  it is a thicker fabric so it keeps you warm  and my favorite part is that it is long. i like longer cardigans that you can easily pair with skinny jeans. the only drawback is there is no way to close this cardigan  likely if i end up purchasing this i will also purchase some sort of broach to pin it with or pair it with one of the belts i have from retailer to
1,I love this flirty  well fitted dress! quality material!
-1,This is not a kimono. it's a cocoon. there's a huge difference.  it's also not made very well.
-1,I wanted to love this top -- looks so comfy and cute. but hangs like a bag. going back!
0,"I hoped  from the picture  that this would be more of a ""straight down"" sort of fit. retailer is usually really great at selling tops that flatter hips without having an obvious bell shape to them. however  the top had too much of a ""flare out"" bell-shaped vibe. i need to be able to wear this with maxi skirts in the summer  but this top would be too sack-like and billowy with those. i think it would only work with jeans/trousers. my final objection was the arm holes - the way they are cut "
0,Very cute coat but could not keep it for the price...just not sure it is worth almost $200 00 (with tax added to cost). when it goes on sale  i will most likely buy it.
-1,I had high hopes for this cute top but it runs very short. it is not as long as it appears on the model so it looked odd when i put it on. unfortunately it had to go back. bummer cuz it was very cute in the pix!
0,This dress is not what i expected. the bottom half is wool-like material-looks like someone has worn it. the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry. when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms. i wouldn't of paid full price but for the amount  i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter.
1,Love the sleeves - good length and fit. it's a basic tee that has added flare.
0,This is a darling little sweater. it is well made and the fit is true to size  however  it's just not long enough on me to be a top  which is what i was hoping for.  i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of 40's style but it's way to short on me for that. even with my highest waisted pants and skirts  it shows skin.  i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something.  that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos.  i'm still
1,I was looking for a top to go with leggings that didn't look like a sack and this is perfect. the v-neck and unusual cut on the bottom makes it more interesting than a typical tunic and the fabric is so snuggly. love it.
-1,This is a cute top but it runs pretty big. order a size down. the material is like a thick gauze almost  so i'd definitely wear a tank under.
0,After reading all the reviews  i ordered up a size. the problem isn't that it runs small. it's that they took the bodice of a true size and stuck it on the skirt of a small size. or if you want to think of it differently - the bodice of a large size on to the skirt of a true size. the 4 top with the 6 bottom would be perfect. unfortunately - you get a size 4 fitted bodice with a skirt that puckers at the back and shows all your flaws (spare tire) or a size 6 that is atrociously long in the torso
0,This was a fail for me. although i ordered size large it barely fit my midsection when tied and was too small in the waist. the fabric is nice though. best on thinner frames than mine.
0,This top is really beautiful. the color is rich and the texture on the back is a unique touch. and i think it might have worked for me except that i could only find a m/l and it was just too big. i love drapey styles and think this top would have been just the right amount of drapey if i'd been able to snag a smaller size. but the m/l looked like a teal sack  so it's going back.
-1,This is a great cut and looks good on. it is a very poor quality material. it balled and frayed in two wears. i returned it to the store.
1,It's simply a super cute and versatile jumpsuit. you can wear it as is or over a shirt or t-neck. drapes well  hangs well. looks good from the front and the back. i am 5-5  120 lb  size 4 fits perfectly. only drawback  has to be dry cleaned...
-1,I ordered this in a l online  and wasn't a fan when i received it. the colors are pretty bright  but they also look cheap in my opinion. it also had an awkward fit  because of the material there is no give at all  it was really tight on my chest (36d) for reference. and it was also pretty short  and i'm short! it barely hit the top of my pants...and i'm 5'2! back it went.
0,These pants come in great colors and fit nicely if you determine your correct size  which may not be what you usually wear. i have several pair  but i am concerned about investing anymore because of all the complaints on dye stability. retailer is going to have to address this if it is going to continue carrying this product. now  that said  i had a bad accident on one pair of these pants  and the outcome was successful. i wore them to a dinner party and spilled grease on them from one of t
0,These are great for summer except you need to size down! unless the pair i received was an anomaly  these run very large!
-1,Love this top! but unfortunately i returned it for exchange coz it was too small for me. hoping there's a sz sm in stock.
0,I found it very thin and much more sheer than i expected. not sure i could get away with wearing it without a slip.sadly i'll be returning it. also  runs a bit large. would have returned it for an xs if i loved it.
1,T la is such a great brand for t shirts! this one is so soft and comfy and the yellow color is a great neutral yellow.
-1,I wanted to like this but it just didn't have much of a shape  not flattering at all. maybe if i was taller?
1,I will preface this review by stating that this item was available only in one size at my local retailer. they have a section of dresses mostly offered online that are in store for you to touch  see  try on and order through the store (which is much appreciated). i am normally a size 0-2/xs in retailer clothes and i will typically order a petite when available. the option my store had to try on was a regular medium which is what i have pictured here.    i mostly wanted to try it on just to get a fee
0,I love the look of this jacket. it's incredibly soft and fits tts. i love how it's a little different and fun. however  it's already pilling after 3 wears. probably have gotten a total of 15 hours of wear out of it. i am so disappointed. for this price point  i would have expected better quality.
-1,Where o where did the old pilcro ankle stet go??? these are a cheap impersonator. the denim used to be thick which really did wonders for the fit and overall appearance of how the denim lays over your lower half. the last 3 pairs of pilcro stets i've ordered have gone right back because they are nowhere close to the greatness they were originally. the pockets on these jeans sit so so low- completely unflattering. the ankles are significantly smaller circumferentially. the old stet ankle jeans ha
-1,"I bought this dress in an xs  and am 5'4""  115 lbs  and fairly proportional. the shoulders were snug  but the hips (and maybe waist)were at least 2-3x too big. comically so-- the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side."
0,This is a heavy dress - it's surprising when you lift up the hanger how much it weighs because it looks like a light sundress. and on my frame  which is pretty thin  it hits my shoulders and then my hips and just falls... so the heft of it means there's no waistline... it's an odd fit. the color is gorgeous  but the lack of shape made this a no.
-1,"I'm petite  and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater - that is the look that is portrayed on the model. the sweater is scratchy  the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right. it looks great on the model here  but not on me. going back. so bummed. the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little ""holes"" or openings across the shoulders. so there is a tiny bit of detail. overall  not a great sweater."
-1,I loved this romper so much! the material is thin  but perfect for summer. the style is just what i was looking for. it's so so cute and fit perfectly...at first. i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition. it went from loose and flowy  like on the model  to little booty shorts and a body suit...not the look i was going for. i am so disappointed.
1,This dress was just perfect. the fit was just right and it is made well. love the ruffles... could definitely be dressed up or wore casual. great dress all around ... a keeper!!!
1,"The print on this is gorgeous  and it's incredibly comfortable. ultimately  i didn't buy it because the length was weird for me (i'm 5'7""); it just looked strange  like it was cutting me off at a weird point."
0,I usually wear a small  4 or 6 and in this dress i couldn't even zip up the 8. so tight in the rib cage and chest. if i tried to go up even further the bottom half got much bigger. guess this one is not for me.
-1,I loved this shirt when it first arrived and i couldn't wait to wear it. after one day of wear  i went to hang the shirt back up and it was ripping on both sides of the middle back seem. this shirt was not tight on me at all. very disappointed.
-1,Looked good in pictures. i even ordered an xxs petite and it was huge! although the sweater has interesting textures and is very beautiful  it is very awkward and poor fit. will be sending back.
-1,Based on the other reviews  i sized down from my usual 6p to a 2p  but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering. i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it wouldn't work. i can't imagine this would flatter very many people. the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive. very disappointed--this will be going back for sure.
0,I really liked this top but when i tried it on it was big and too boxy. i considered ordering it in petite but the sales person said that the cut would be the same  boxy but shorter so i decided to pass.
-1,"I agree with the other reviewer that the belted part definitely gives some great definition for those with a defined waist and that it's a much lovelier color in person  but that's about it for me. thoughts below:  _____________  pros:  - tts. i ordered the medium for my 36c  5'9"" frame and found it sufficient.  - the color is much nicer in person  as the other reviewer mentioned. it's a richer brown. think ""mocha latte"" in terms of color.  - the belt really helps tie it all together and keep it"
1,Unique pattern. got lots of compliments! great fall accessory!
1,In the photo i loved the colors. in person though  the print on mine had the four huge pink lily flowers on the front and it just wasn't the look i was hoping for  like the photo. also  i failed to notice in the photo that there's elastic along the seam of the butt! this seems silly and unnecessary.... it's not terribly noticeable on  but still i felt weird. the fabric is thick and not see-thru and the quality is fine  but the combination for the shifted print and the unexpected ruching and thes
0,Super large and a very weird cut.  the sides were much shorter than the front and back and this just looked awful on me.
1,I was unsure about the color when i got it in the mail but it is very flattering. it is roomy for sure. with a pair of slim shorts or pants it looks great though. creasing may be an issue. 5ft 6  135 lbs 36 d...the xs looks good with room to spare.  nice weight fabric for fall.
0,I wish these zipped up instead of the drawstring. they are super cute but don't care for the way they sit on the hips.
-1,"Like previous reviewers have said  these run a bit small and i'm surprised no one's mentioned that these are very high rise. for reference  i'm 5'7""  130 lbs  34-27-37  and am an retailer size 4 in tops and pants. i really wanted to love these pants  but even after ordering a size up and trying on a 6  i was still not in love. and the other reviewers are right ? the back zipper is kinda hard to zip up. the top of these pants are exactly the same as the essential flares  so if you're thinking of ge"
1,Trying hard to stay away from tops that are basic tees and branch out with patterns and different cuts. never thought i'd find both in one top. love this! i put it on and knew i had to take it home. it's fitted but not  busy but just enough so  and it's made in the usa! can't go wrong.
-1,"I am 5'6""  130 lbs with an athletic body type and i ordered a size small. these were really baggy in the thigh/quadricep area and made my thighs look bulky. the fabric quality is very nice and i like the idea of them for curvier body types. my son commented that they looked like pajama pants and i agreed."
1,Loved this dress and was even happier to learn i could order it in petite!!
0,"I read the other reviews before i purchased this jumpsuit because it's very cute. as another 5'3"" reviewer mentioned it will be longer so for me that's a plus but i have thighs  not huge but regular well proportioned woman thighs and boobs. it was a little tight but doable around my thighs but my boobs got ""lost in the sauce"". i gotta love it to keep it and i don't. it's a great print and fabric though."
-1,I love byron lars dresses  and this design is on-point. the ruffle at the neckline is so pretty  and the dress fits like a dream. however -- the fabric!!! i would have loved it if this dress had a heavier feel. this is  sadly  going back today.
0,I love the fabric and design of these leggings  but unfortunately they ran way to big up top. they literally fall down.
1,True to size  very pretty.  as pictured expect that it is more peachy and not this light.  i like it and will keep it but just be aware that it is not a pale pink as in the picture.
-1,Fits and lots nothing like picture. very wide like a tent dress!
1,I am pleased with this skirt. the jean material is of good quality and it hangs right on my waist and hips. i ordered a 2 which left a little room in the waist to tuck in a blouse. i am 5/5 and 119. it works well for work and leisure.
0,When i read all these positive reviews i did not hesitated  as i wanted good basics which will be good investment in me as looking good is always investment. well  i love blue color as i am blonde wih blue eyes and this color makes my eyes brighter and matches almost everything but..the design of the shirt is made oversize fit basically the shirt should not be dressed as fitted it's more relaxed fit so if you wear medium go head and order medium even if the small fits unless you want to look lik
-1,Maternity like  and although the back is really cool  there is too much material in the front and it is almost like thin ribbed long underwear/pajama. returned.
1,"I'm a sucker for lace details that dress up an otherwise plain white shirt. the shoulder and sleeve lace is well done on this top  and the cut is flattering  skimming over the body. i appreciated that the product notes included the length  as i ordered a petite s (i'm 5'4""  120 lbs) and the fit was perfect. a regular s would have been too long for me. the fabric is soft and fluid. i wish it were a little more substantial  but that's a minor quibble."
-1,I tried this shirt at my local retailer and absolutely loved it ...until i read dry clean only!!!  really retailer? i know you can do better than that...
0,The design looked super cute online  but in person  the material seemed cheap. actually  at least in the green one  the material is different in the striped and solid sections; if it had all been the striped material  it would have been much nicer.
0,I'm obsessed with this skirt and was so excited when it came in the mail. i ordered a m  and it was massive! i'm 5'9 and typically wear a 6 or an 8. as i don't really have much of a waist/am built more like a column  i wanted it to sit right at my waist/right under my ribs. wanted to wear a crop top with it  but it fell down to my hips which made me look significantly larger. the quality is amazing  and the skirt is even better looking in person! worth ordering in a size down and getting it tail
1,Beautiful color and super comfy. it runs large but the gathers still allow for it to have shape on the top.
0,I loved almost everything about this skirt. thick and lined and love the buttons. comfortable. the only problem was that the two sides flared out at the bottom  presumably from the buttons. i was torn  but in the end it just looked too silly and it was sent back.
1,"I bought a size small (5'6"" & 130lbs). it was baggy everywhere so i added a belt similar to the model and it did help some but the pockets stuck out too much. i ended up looking ""hippy"" with no butt. the material is nice and it is a nice quality. i just didn't have enough to fill it out anywhere and i felt if i got a xs it would have been too short in the crotch area."
-1,The dress is just ok. i cannot imagine having paid full price for this. i got it for florida vacation. i put it on to wear to church first and spilled a drop of lavender oil on it and it stained!!!! cant get it out. thats punk for a dress that even on sale is like.   sending back
1,I just received this in the wine color and it's gorgeous! it fits well and is very pretty. it can be dressed up or down. i can't wait until the weather warms up and i get to wear this. i have already ordered the other color! great purchase.
-1,I received this as a gift. it is a very pretty top  but the material is sooo delicate that the cutout areas were torn in many spots and where it wasn't torn completely you could see it fraying. the sales associate said they get many returns on this item.
1,Very pretty dress but the fit is not great. i have to get help to take it off because it's tight in the shoulders.
1,I bought this for my sister. it is perfect for your favorite cat lover  the print is adorable up close but not overwhelming to secretly hide your crazy cat lady intentions. i love this myself  the material is soft and it's a perfect flowy blouse for day to night.
1,I love this coat  and wanted it to fit so badly! a 12-14 always fits well  but i can't even start to button up the large in this coat. so sad!!!
0,I ordered this in white. the material is similar to a polo shirt  which i hadn't counted on. it was also on the large size and just unflattering on me. still  the quality seemed to be good.
0,I was disappointed that this dress had no pockets  as every picture on this website suggests. otherwise  it is a great color and shape. still sad though...
