-1,I ordered in blue. so excited at arrival; it looked gorgeous...then i tried it on! i'm 5'  106#  34d and my upper arms are a little muscular. i normally order 2p (sometimes 0p)...and never a problem. this top was sooo tight under the arms and at the upper arms...if i tried any movement would have probably ripped out the seams! maybe i just received a product that was mis-sized  or defective. all i can say  if you have skinny arms  you'll love it.
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.
0,I went on a wild goose chase for these jeans  as they were sold out all around the country. i finally got the last pair from some store in the midwest! they are my favorite pair of jeans  they fit very well. however  for the price  they should not get loose and baggy after 1-2 wears. i hate that they need to be washed and dried so often so that they will fit properly. expensive jeans should not sag. i have abercrombie jeggings for a fraction of the price that never get loose  even after 20 wears
1,"The design and colors on this sweater arguably make it a ""statement sweater"". it has a modified raglan type sleeve. i found the sleeves to fit just fine. for reference  i am 5'9""  150 lbs.  34dddd  and the medium fit perfectly. it is not a long sweater and  with my height  i wear a long tank top or cami underneath. i love the way it looks."
1,"This tunic is a great way to wear the plaid trend right now without it being the traditional collared shirt. it's fun  comfortable and has great style. the first time i wore it i got tons of compliments! i'm 5'8"" and the back of the shirt goes to the back of my knees  i usually wear a size 12 and the large fit great!"
0,I get that it's a swing style top and supposed to be loose but it looked so much bigger on me than on the model and just not flattering at all.
0,Bought this early in the season - probably washed and worn <8 times and there are small holes that have formed in the front towards the bottom...bummer!
0,Size up i was surprised that the fit was small i always seem to wear a 6 in retailer pencil skirts this was tight!
-1,Great color but frumpy fit. if you have any bust  it looks a bit like maternity
1,I was going to re-turn this.top  i was really on the fence.  so glad i didn't  it is.comfortable and easy to wear. lace is a little restrictive  but willing  to over look  it because i look so cute
-1,This is a gorgeous top. very well made with a classy design. it fits true to size from the lower chest up. however  at about the mid-belly range  the shirt widens out and basically allows a 5 month twin pregnancy to comfortably fit in. size xs. i was so sad. for the price  i can't justify taking it for alterations. it would have been the perfect top.
-1,My personal opinion is that i am not a fan of this top  the material of the fabric doesn't seem as nice as delettas other tops and it had a really boxy fit on me. i wanted to love this top but i did not.
0,The color on these are amazing. i am 5'2 and these are really meant for that long lean profile. note they have very little stretch.
-1,I was so excited to try these but was really disappointed in the fit. i found the legs and butt to be tight but the waist to be really big. if you are normally a size 24  i wouldn't bother with these.
0,"This is really a cute top  nice fabric  the print (the version i bought) is lovely though the colors are different than pictured. the problem for me is that i am 5'8""  36b with a longer torso and the proportions were just wrong on my body. the blouse does not have much shape at all and fell a bit too short for my liking  especially in the front. it hit at hip level  as in photo  but would look so much better if it had been a couple inches longer. looking at the other reviews i see that most of t"
-1,"This shirt is adorable.  but...it didn't work for me!  i'm a smaller gal with a large chest (5'4""  34g). i tried on the small  since it seemed so flowy and large. the sleeves were tight  yet the back of the shirt flowed way too much  making the shirt look huge on me. perhaps a more fitted back  and i would have been in love.  love the blue color!"
0,The shirt is mostly a thick sweatshirt material and is very short when trying on - undershirt required to make up for length and the see through mesh in the pattern.  felt about 1 size too small as well
-1,This is a very slimming  well-made  nice fitting top-i just disliked the colors. they did not look good on me. otherwise this is a very nice piece!
-1,This is a gorgeous print  but i found it too fussy for my taste.  it is quite shapeless so i tried doing a half tuck. it looked cute for about 2 seconds  but then i had to worry about keeping the shoulders down.
-1,This was completely different than i expected. the xs/s was so large that it looked messy. unfortunately i had to return it.
0,It feels soft and like a good quality. however it really does run large and long. i was looking for a loose tank but this one was almost a tunic on my short height and even with a cardigan to give it a shape didn't work out. i also thought it would shrink in the dryer but it didn't. also wrinkles easily.
-1,I was really disappointed when i tried this top on. the design and cut of the neckline is very bulky and just off. the cut of the top overall was just off.
1,I love this sweater! it does run a little large though. fits beautifully. great for cool summer nights and early fall. dress up or down.
-1,So  i want to start off by saying  the quality of this shirt really was great. as was the pattern  unfortunately if you're going off the picture know that they definitely pinned in the sides on the model. this shirt has a full on triangle shape and flares significantly towards the bottom  it's not a straight fit as the picture would suggest. i'm sure this works for some women but if you're muscular with an already v-shape to your body (meaning your shoulders are significantly sized and you have
1,Very nice top  fits true to size  a little short buy looks nice with jeans or work pants
0,I don't know why this piece is so wide around the body. the fabric is very good. just the design is way boxy. i get xsp  still boxy.
1,I love the style and quality of this blouse. it can easily be dressed up or down. the blouse is completely see through and delicate. still  it is so romantic  feminine  distinctive and timeless.
1,This dress pops! gorgeous colors and simple  classic flowy design. i thought it ran a little big  i ended up with xs for best overall fit in chest and a more streamline flow. 34b for reference.
0,I was so excited when i saw this dress! i love this color  and the poplin sleeves. i was so sad when i tried it on though  the back poofed out in such a weird and unflattering way. i think it is because there is a pleat high up in the back  but then it seems like it gets narrow again around the hips. strange. also the material is kind of stiff and seems poor quality. i do love the way the top and the sleeves look on me though  so i am actually considering keeping it and just making it into a top
-1,Was going to order this top in orange but could not decide what size. i am either a large or xl. i found that the top was in stock in a local retailer in white and went to try it for size. first  the top is huge. i tried the large on and it fit me across the bust and shoulders nicely. the rest of the top was like a large tent. the white is an off white and really is not attractive looking. in fact  in the store  it was displayed with a jacket over it. online  the orange looks completely different 
1,This top is cute! it adds a pop of color to my day and seems to be of high quality. the colors seem more vibrant in person and the material is quite soft and stretchy. as another reviewer pointed out  the peplum is only in the front! it sounds really weird but i don't really mind the look because i'll be wearing a jacket over it. i'm usually a size 12/14 with a 36dd bust and the large fits beautifully.
1,This dress is perfect for my florida lifestyle because of the fabric and the design. it is not the color pictured on the web page which was a disappointment. the color is a lot duller. i tried it on in the store and found it to be tight across the chest  another lady who also tried it had the same problem. i went home and ordered a larger size. that dress was baggy and not as cute in the back. i realized because of the under slip it could be left open to the waist and work just fine. i ended up
1,I am usually a 00 or 0 in dresses  and i ended up with a 4 in this one. i could barley zip up the 0  and while i could have gotten away with the 2  there is no elasticity in the waistband. the 4 is very slightly roomy  but more comfortable than the smaller sizes on me. for reference  i'm 109-111 lbs  5'4  and a 30b.     when i was finally able to wear the dress  i got compliments galore. it really is a beautiful dress! just be sure to size up!
-1,I was so excited to order this dress. i loved that it had a normal neck  nice length  and there wasn't a hole in the back. but this dress is just plain awful. the top fit tight across the bust  it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra. then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric. i could not get the zipper to lay flat. the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling. on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the
1,If you happen to get a size that fits you  you will love these leggings. they are true to size when the quality control works. i got 2 pair  both in size 28 - one fits perfectly and the other fits like my mothers high waisted jeans! the material is very soft and comfortable. also  not sure who named these colors  but the grey is really light purple and the dark grey is dark purple.
0,This is a pretty top but the arm sleeves are scratchy. i have sensitive skin  and had to return it because of this. otherwise  it would have been a keeper.
1,I really wanted to like this dress on me  but it was not to be. the color is one of my favorites  but the dress accented all my problem areas. sadly  i returned it. i'm sure that someone with less substantial hips will look great in it.
-1,This shirt is so small. i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit. don't waste your time on this shirt. such a shame  it could have been very cute.
-1,I wish i had read more of the reviews....but thought i would give it a try. the shirt doesn't seem as long as on the model but the armpits are sewn to hit mid shirt. this would be ok if it was the length pictured  but since it isn't it makes you look very boxy. i don't know if i ordered a size too big or if it is just the way the shirt was made. wanted to love for fall.....unfortunately  i am taking back.
0,Soft  stretch denim  70's fun vibe . i so wanted to keep this   but for me the sizing was off. i ordered a size 27  my usual denim jeans size . the waist down fit perfectly but i couldn't zip the top portion. i fear that even if i order one size up which i believe would still be ok for the bottom half ; i still won't have enough room from my rib cage to the top of the bib section. i had  a 3 inch gap  in that area  . for full disclosure   i am a  size 36b  with broad shoulders and  a broad back
0,I was so excited to try this on--but this was a big nope for me unfortunately. i ordered both an xs and s (i normally wear a s)  both hung horribly on me  they were just too big. i love a boxy  oversized silhouette but this sadly didn't flatter me in the least.
0,So this is still a pretty cute shirt  but my xs is missing the ruffle in the front and has layers on the bottom front of shirt. it doesn't seem to be defective  just a different version of the shirt. i'm curious to find out from others if they have gotten the same shirt as i have. still deciding whether to keep or not. no more left in xs to place another order and see what's up. i do wish it had the ruffle in front  as that is what caught my eye.
1,Love  love  love this dress! i needed a fun but not over the top dress for family pictures and this was perfect. great pop of color and looked amazing with over the knee boots. i see myself wearing this thru the holidays and will likely throw on with a jean jacket. i found it true to size - my normal size 4 fits me well. buy this dress - you won't regret it!
-1,Unfortunately  this sweater let me down! i love retailer  especially their sweaters  but this one fell flat. it was tight on the arms  and didn't hang well on my body. it was odd in length and added about 20lb to my frame. i kept it because i wanted to force it to work  alas  i just donated it. hopefully it fits someone else better than me..
0,Contrary to some of the reviews posted the dress is not excessively sheer. you can't see black underwear thru the fabric  but you can see the body's silhouette in front of a light source. it's not lingerie sheer  but more like a medium weight gauze (without the wrinkles). if you're older or modest the sheerness may bother  otherwise (due to the print) it shouldn't be much of a factor.    now on to the size... i'm a plus size girl (size 18) and based on reviews saying the dress was huge  i ordere
0,The fabric felt beautiful  and it felt great on  but once i looked in the mirror it just looked too housedress like. maybe because it runs large. the price seemed high as well. i wanted to love it but i had to return.
0,While i love the design  this sweater even in the small is too over-sized for me and was unflattering. it was returned.
-1,The top red is more like orange. was disappointed and returned it
-1,So you're thinking this is a red and black skirt right? nope. it's an obnoxious cherry red netting with cranberry crushed velvet insets overlaid on bright red actual spandex. spandex that shows every wrinkle and panty line. it's really god awful.
0,This sweater is really cute  great fit and unique style. unfortunately the ivory color was more yellow than i like. not the right shade for my skin tone.
-1,This top is very cute and if you are short you will love it. i am tall and the dividing line of color block kept rising up over my bust so it looked weird. it made it look like an ill fitting maternity top. had to go back.
-1,Cute and very soft  but the elastic wasn't sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear.
1,Gorgeous dress but fits really large. ordered a petite large. going to send it back and try the petite medium. wish it was available at my store to try on and not have to wait for it to be reshipped.
1,This is really a gorgeous blouse. the design is very feminine and elegant  and fits true to size. i didn't think it ran short and the material is light and airy. it sold out so quickly so i had to wait awhile and managed to get my hands on a 4 when it was available for a quick second. it was def. worth the wait. a gorgeous top.
1,Can't say about fit just yet since it is a gift; color is soft green and versatile. finishing touches around edges and in back make it a stand out sweater that dresses up jeans but also nice over a dress or with skirt
-1,I ordered this in size xl. the ivory was as pictured. the lace details were well-done. but  the length was much shorter than on the model. i'm 5 ft. 5 1/2 in. for reference. even the sleeves were on the short side  above my wrists. the main problem is how much it shed. just in trying it on  there was fuzz everywhere so i returned it. i love when retailer mixes lace into the knit of sweaters. this one just didn't work out.
0,Great jeans by pilcro  too short and snug around my knees for keeping though.
-1,I'm normally a size 25p. i bought these in a 26 because i wanted a more relaxed fit. i could barely pull them up over my calves. i could get them on and button them  but i felt like a sausage stuffed into a straw. size up 2 sizes at least!
1,I have a pair of elevenses very similar to the turquoise and grey pair  and i get non-stop compliments on them. they are very flattering and drape beautifully. the fabric is also complete no-fuss and no-fade. this time  i went for the red pair  and i love them. they really go with the current upscale 70s vibe; they have the 70s attitude without the poor quality of most vintage 70s clothes.
1,This is a beautiful piece--and a really great deal on sale. it is sheer  but with a simple slip underneath it will work well for a comfortable but special-looking summer outfit!
-1,I ordered the ivory of this dress  expecting it to be a nice dress i could wear into my second trimester of pregnancy. instead  i received a dress that looks like a ugly  vintage-gone-wrong curtain of fabric. the 'ivory' is the color of yellowed newspapers. the fabric was cheap and had thread pieces sticking up all over the place. i would've been better off sewing myself a dress out of drapes a la gone with the wind or sound of music. the fit isn't that great  either. big and boxy. it could acco
1,This blouse is the definition of how to wear plaid and not feel like a lumberjack.. living in l.a. it's 90 degrees one day  and 60 the next. the lightweight fabric is perfect for our ever changing climate. it runs true to size and is very comfy. thinking of wearing it for thanksgiving dinner.
0,As with most retailer tops  this sweater is boxy and baggy through the middle.  i ordered an xs.  it's a very nice  pretty sweater that i'm going to try in an xxs.  the v-neck does go down rather low so it will need a tank underneath. the lace accents are very delicate and make the sweater look more upscale.  the white is a soft winter white.
-1,"Yikes. there is a whole lot of skirt here. i am 5""4  weigh around 120 lb  and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing  depending on the designer. this skirt balloons out from the waist. on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist. i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking. the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf. there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect. definitely returning."
1,I saw this dress in the store tried it on and   love! it is so hard to find a white dress that is not too fancy or frilly. this dress fits great and flatters my full figure (size 12 to 14)  plus it has pockets! the woven material with the big fun flowers is accented by the plain band at the bottom which falls just above the knee. the center of the flower adds a nice three dimensional touch. i brought it in a large and i will wear this lovely feminine flirty beauty all spring and summer. from fun
1,When i received this blouse  ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky. some of the fabric would stick to these dots. i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid. however  after hanging on my closet door  the dots are still sticky. i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me.
0,I wanted to love this top. the neckline made it look strange on me. if i untied it  it looked sloppy. so  it went back. i love the print though.
1,I bought this lovely silk/velvet shirt in the &quot;sky&quot; color but it is more on the teal blue side than sky blue  which disappointed me. it is definitely darker than appears in photo. still a luxurious well-made beauty with sassy appeal. it drapes like a snake slithering down your body. it comes with attitude.
1,I'm 5'4 with an hourglass shape. i love this dress. it drapes nicely  the material won't be hot for summer and the color is perfect for my olive complexion.
0,The color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person. the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i'd imagined from the photos. it has a quilted quality so doesn't drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms. i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large. i think a medium might have been better. haven't decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return. has an artsy  cool professor vibe that i like.
0,I love the shape at the neck but the lack of shape really distracted me from loving this top. the fabric is nice but the big  boxy shape on the bottom doesn't do much for you. i agree with the other reviewers tha this top would be great as a maternity top because it really is cute if you have a baby bump. returning the top.
1,Lightweight and cute. these pants do run on the larger side  which is fine is you like a more relaxed look. i usually wear a 10-12 in pants and i had to exchange the large for a medium which fit much better. great for summer weather!
