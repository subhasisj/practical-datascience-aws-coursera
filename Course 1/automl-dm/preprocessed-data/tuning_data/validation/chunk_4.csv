0,This dress is beautiful. the fabric is light weight but textured and interesting  and the purple is gorgeous. the soft pink was a bit more orange than i expected  but not a deal breaker. the problem i had with the dress was fit around the arms. i sized up and was glad that i did because it runs small up top  but because the straps come in a bit around the arm holes  it creates armpit fat  which is not a problem i usually have. i could wear the dress with a sweater  but you wouldn't be able to se
-1,I really wanted to love this dress  but it just didn't fit in anyway. i ordered an xs petite  and it was very large. the lacing in the back is completely useless  and that's what i liked about the dress. i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top (because of chest) and then lace more tightly near the waist. it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering. beautiful fabric  great color combo  bad fit.
-1,I ordered this dress online. the previous reviews were accurate that it runs small  particularly in the waist. i normally wear a 0 or 2  but i ordered the 4. it fit my waist and hips but was slightly loose at the top even though i am a 34c. i liked the look  but it had a hole where the seams had come apart between the black stripe across the chest and the main fabric. additionally  the black squares were pulled in several places with threads sticking out. i returned it immediately.
0,This skirt ran short  small  and boxy. if you can get the right fit  the skirt is great quality and super cute  but i recommend trying on in store for sizing.
0,The shirt is beautifully made and very comfortable. i'm a medium though  and i ordered as such- but it's way too big for me.
1,"This dress is very feminine and flattering on  especially for hourglass figure gals. i usually wear size 4 regular in this brand but i sized up to 6 regular (i'm 34b  26 waist  36 hips). when it's very fitted on top  i like my dress to be a bit longer. the bottom hem falls about 2 inches longer on me than shown on the model (i'm 5'2""). it feels tight when first zipped because the dress is cut to fit the curves of a woman  but it loosens up after a few minutes of wear. the design of this dress is"
1,I just received this coat and love it. the only downside is that online the color looks like a royal blue (which i wanted) but in truth the coat is a basic navy. this was not a deal breaker for me. i love the details. it is not lined as someone mentioned earlier but it's not meant to be a heavy winter coat. i can't wait to wear it with jeans  boots and a striped or plaid tunic.
-1,I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail  i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online  the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat  i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!
0,I tried this dress in an xs (my usual size) and it is tts. i love the fabric and pattern and the tiers of the dress are pretty. however  the color kind of washed me out and the neckline made the dress look matronly on me. i didn&#39;t get the dress and wished it worked out.
-1,I have several maeve dresses that fit really well. this was not the case with this dress. fabric and color are great! fit was off especially in top. worst part was zipper that wouldn't move smoothly. took me a good 15 minutes to get it unzipped. such a bummer!
1,Love this dress. i wear a size large  but had to return and order a medium  planning to wear with boots. it's a light dress  cute for work. the only downside is that it wrinkles easily.
1,I absolutely love the print. it's what caught my eye first when scrolling down the page. the fabric is very soft  single layer. the model definitely makes this shirt look slimmer or tighter to the body than the shirt actually is. the slimmer fit was the next thing i was looking forward to  but like other reviews  it is very flowy and the fabric falls away from the bottom below the bust (which i'm not mad about when wearing this in the summer--the occasional breeze will feel nicer with a loose to
1,"I loved this dress the moment i first saw it! i have another dress from this brand that i've had for a couple years and wear it all the time plus i love the tie waist detail. however after trying this dress in both a size medium (my typical size) and a small  i've given up. it does not look good on me and i think thats because i am a 34b  there is room in the chest even in the size small. so would look really good on a curvy girl! i'm 5'5"" ordered regular size and it came to just above my knees."
0,As much as i had wanted this to work for me  it didn't. fabric is not as soft as i had expected and quality is just bad. i purchased this online (on sale at $29.95) and i had envisioned this to be comfy stretchy and swingy with a flow. i sent this back to the store as it didn't seem fit even at the low price.
-1,The dress is extremely high quality! i purchased the dress in black. the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress. the dress overall is like a balloon. unless you're extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger! i ordered the small petite and am 125 lbs and 5'4. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it's going back:( the petite hits 3 inches above the knee for reference.
1,"I am 5'8"" size 4-6 us. i could barely zip the inside bra on the 8. i wear 34 b. i think it is uk sizing. i kept the 8 ( had to return the 6). it's a beautiful dress but it is a lot of dress. maybe too much for someone more petite. it looks ridiculous until you put the belt on:)"
-1,I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs  32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me.
-1,I love tiny button down tops. this one didn't work at all for me. i was excited about the mix prints but on it looked like i was wearing a vest over a striped shirt. also the arm was frayed on the shirt i tried on.
-1,Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however  even if you have skinny arms like i do  the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in. i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested. the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon.
0,"Cute print on both sides  but far more ""cheek"" was exposed than i anticipated from the photos. the front isn't too skimpy  but the back is a bit too small for my taste. definitely narrower in the back than a standard bikini cut. too bad :( the matching top is my favorite top  so i guess i'll just have to wear black bottoms with it."
-1,This top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry. the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity. the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more.     buy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things.
1,This was on display when walked into my local retailer  it's just a beautiful in person. my mistake was trying it on  instant love! i tried on my usual size small & it fit perfectly. i would usually wait for something in this price range to go on sale  but i just had to have this. worth the splurge!
-1,Horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath
0,"I recommen only becuase i like it on other people  but not on me. the pull on style didn't work  i need xs petite to fit lenght and waist  but the waist wasn't elastic enough to ""pull up"" (i have let's say a booty#. i kept hearing hte stiching give... it also looked a little too poooofffy on my frmae  i am 5'1.5"" and it stuck more out than on the model. nice idea  btu not for me. #i am 115 lbs#"
0,I normally wear regular s  but even the xsp is too wide on me. it is really maternity wear.     also  since the material is thin  the ivory is too shear for my liking.
1,I love this bralette. i have it in other colors as well and it is always the one i go to when i want comfort.
1,I really like this top! it's lightweight  great quality  and i've worn it for casual weekend outings and also dressed up for work.
0,Pretty disappointed in this sweater. should have sized down because it's quite wide. i also didn't like the stair step. the back clung to my rear. not attractive. the colors seemed to be striking online but in reality are not. returning mine.
-1,"My 3 daughters and i all wear a size small and are heights range between 5'2 and 5'10 . this dress was sloppy on every one of us. i don't think a size x small would have made a difference. the length is all over the place .i""m not sure how or where you would fit a bra into the picture. on the positive side was very soft. it may work as a beach cover -up."
0,I bought this top in lilac size s since other reviewers said it has a lot of fabric. the color and the quality were great -- loved that it had the lining underneath. if your bust is bigger than an a cup  beware. the top basically flared out from the farthest point on my bust and the fabric below just hung there. it was a pregnancy look. perhaps that's why the model has her arms crossed in front -- to give the illusion that it tapers in below the ribs  but it does not. unfortunately  this one is
1,Purchased this top at my local store and it is very flattering! not to boxy  hits at the hip and drapes nice. great for work or with jeans. i purchase the navy faux fur scarf to wear around the neck and wow!
0,What a huge dissippointment when this arrived home.....  the sleeves are very long and very boxy... i have no idea the condition of this on store  but came with damages on sleeves also  we can tell that was something wrong and i was surprise that retailer sent me something like that  i'm a customer here for a very long time!!!!  dissipointed!!!! ;(
-1,I saw this dress online and really wanted to love it... unfortunately it wasn't at all as expected in person.  as the previous reviewer mentioned it is extremely itchy material  which was already pilling on many of the dresses displayed in the store. the neck was extremely tight; a problem i've never encountered with any retailer dress. additionally it seems to have a kangaroo pocket located right underneath the bust line  which protruded in an unflattering way. the pocket is not at all not
0,I ordered the stress in an xl. i usually wear a size 12 in most retailer clothes. the pattern and the flow of the dress is very beautiful but it runs extremely small. also  i felt that i was choking. it is better suited for thin women.
-1,I bought this skirt in my usual xxs petite and the waist was way too small. i could not even pull the skirt all the way up. returned
-1,This a great skirt for someone with a straight or boyish figure. this skirt does not accommodate a curvy figure - small waist  feminine hips.
1,"I like this sweater very much. it's short but not too short  and soft but not fluffy. the design is a little interesting rather than plain and the colors (i ordered the tan) are great for me  a redhead. i'm 5'3""  125 lbs and don't like clingy tops so i took a m and it's perfect. really cutewith jeans."
1,I have this tank in all colors...it is superb for layering...comfortable and i love that you can reverse it for a different neckline...and it's long enough!
0,"I loved the color and lines of this jumpsuit  but found it to be far too short in the torso. (and about 8"" too long in the leg  but that's a lot easier to fix.) i tried sizing up  but it still wasn't working for me. i'm only 5'7""  and while i'm long-waisted i can usually make jumpsuits work. if you have a short torso and long legs  this is a beautiful option. otherwise  i can't recommend it."
1,Love a gray sweater and this one is stunning. layered with a plaid tunic and worn to work  with many compliments. the only downside is the poncho shape  with the large wing like sleeves  makes it impossible to wear a coat over this sweater. if you wanted to wear in the winter cold  you would need a cape. also not an ideal piece if you need to lift your arms for any reason. keeping that in mind though  i still really like it for days when i want to look cute and won't be don't a ton of moving aro
-1,The length of this dress is bizarre.  i can't decide if it's supposed to lay on the floor or not touch it at all - i'm not sure if i like it either way.  also- at this price point  i would have hoped to have the included under layer to not be so transparent.  if you buy this dress  be prepared to invest in a slip and then have the slip tailored to match the high low hem line so that people cannot see your underwear.  the netting and details in this dress are beautiful but delicate- the one i pur
0,I love how this dress is photographed  but when it arrived to my doorstep i was highly disappointed. there seems to be no shape to it whatsoever. the fabric is much stiffer than i was expected i thought it was going to be more like a sweater dress  but it is not an overly comfortable fabric and it does not move like i thought it would when i put it on. this one is going back.
0,I tried this on in-store because i needed a cozy cardigan  but i did not buy it because i felt the quality was poor. it shed all over everything i tried on with it  and i left the store with little balls of sweater flufff all over my pants. disappointed.
0,This runs huge  not large  huge; and hung in quite a baggy way. bought a medium ( 5'10  150 lbs) and i could have gotten an x-tra small. maybe if there were free shipping i would have reordered  but now its just too much of a hassle
-1,I loved the design and look to this shirt  but it ran way big for me. i loved the forgiving fit  but it just wasn't flattering at all. i even went down one size and it still was huge. sad to send this one back.
-1,It hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front. the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap. i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned. did not fit well and was not good quality. very thin
0,Beautiful sweater coat! love that is easy to pop on & head out. i did have to go to a seamstress and have the button moved as it was to large and boxy around my waist area.
-1,This tank (in black) is nice quality  most of the fringe hangs straight and seems to be attached well. it's just too short and too boxy for my figure (curvy/hips). would look good on someone who has straight hips and is not long waisted. since that doesn't describe me  it has to go back.
-1,I tried this shirt in the purple motif  it fit true to size  my normal small worked well. all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in. really? on a white shirt? it annoyed me so much i didn't buy the shirt.
1,Fit is true to size  color is accurate. love the feel of the knit  it's weightier than if anticipated. i'm looking forward to wearing this to my pnw trips.
1,Love this dress! the color is gorgeous! what you don't see until you see the dress in person is the beautiful detail of the stitched flowers on the dress. i received so many compliments when i wore this dress. the sleeves are sheer and the material light weight. you can wear this dress year round. i love these kind of dresses! retailer knows how to do this right! love this store!
-1,I bought 3 shirts in gold  black and red. they arrived larger than expected. after the first wash and air dry they shrunk. i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide. also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash.
0,The dress had great potential  but the top sagged and made the dress look unflattering on me. unfortunately  i had to return it. the length was great  and the back and sides of the dress were nicely tailored and flattering. perhaps this would fit someone else better - i have a 34b/34c bust  and it didn't work for me.
-1,Hate i have to return it - way too long-almost more mid thigh/almost dress length.
1,"1. i'm 5'5"" tall  145 lbs  and 38-32-40. i'm normally a size 10  but i took a 12 in this skirt.  2. it's comfortable and has pockets that you can really put your hands in.  3. sits at high waist. hem hits below the knee.  4. i didn't like the buttons. they are very round and stick out quite far. they are also mismatched. i would have liked them better if they were flatter.  5. i also didn't like the mustard color. it's unflattering to me."
1,This shirt is so soft and luxuriously feeling. the material looks very nice and seems well made. it has a nice length to it  so it can be worn properly with leggings without any worry. i'm a 36d and can't get the button to close properly  so i'd recommend sizing up if this could be an issue for you. overall it will be a very versitile piece i'm excited to add to my wardrobe.
-1,I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived  it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i'm reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this  but where was quality control?
1,Gorgeous skirt. runs a bit big.  well made. perfect for the office and super comfy.
0,Well made but strange fit. the medium was long and narrow  waaay too small.
-1,"I had high hopes for this sweater and when i found it on sale online  i jumped at the opportunity. i am 5'11""  slender and always wear a small in retailer tops. i purchased this in the mint   size small and as soon as i opened the bag  i had doubts. the fabric is terrible  thin and scratchy. it is not soft and supple as i had imagined. the mint color looks faded and the shape is awful. the length of the arms hits in a bizarre spot  the overall length of the sweater cuts me off at the torso and the"
1,Love this top  dramatic in a casual way.  i ordered the teal and love love love it....with skinny jeans or leggings the style is perfect !  i am over 50  so the teal is gorgeous and i think very age appropriate.  i ordered the blue also  a very pretty shade of blue.........but felt in this style  the bright/light colors would be more appropriate for someone younger.  it's a stunning top...........and fits very true to size..........the drama of the ruffle is what sets it apart..  hoping they do
0,"I don't think the sweater looks like the one pictured. it's pretty and i love off the shoulder sweaters  but i have to say it's a little scratchy and its a lighter grey than what shows on my computer screen. if i hadn't gotten it on sale and with an additional birthday discount i would send it back. it also runs big. i got an xs/s and it fits perfectly. im 5'6"" and weigh 140. i usually wear a medium in most things and am a size 8. i like it a lot  but i don't love it. it also reeked of patchouli"
-1,"I don't know who this would fit. looks so cute on the model and i thought this was going to be the perfect between season dress . . . but just looked like a sack! i think the ""knit"" must have stretched into an unnatural shape - especially the arms!"
0,I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum  but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through  so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top  they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer  but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately  these fall in the latter category.
1,I actually ended up buying two of these dresses. i took the first one to the dry cleaner and they chewed up the slip and put a hole in the dress. i was so sad that i went and bought a second one before they could sell out. the good news is that it was on sale! this is an awesome light and airy dress that is great for those hot summer days. i pretty much wear it every opportunity i get. for reference i purchased the small. it's loose but the shoulders  armholes and slip all fit perfectly. i weigh
0,This shirt has a vibrant color and beautiful neck line  but unfortunately i had to send it back. it is short waisted with a lot of material in the back. had it been 1-2 inches longer it may flare out  but based on the length on me  it ended up looking like a shrunken tent. for reference  i am 5'8 with a long torso.
1,These have an amazing fit! i have them in three colors. they are not too low rise  they are not too high. they are the perfect length. the only thing i do not like is the rolled cuff is not stitched and comes down easily if you do not iron down.
1,Beautiful dress! excellent detail! loved everything about this dress except for the weight. this dress is very heavy which limits my wearing options in fl. given the fabric  this is a great special occasion dress.
0,Very orange. the slits in the back are larger than pictured and not at the cutest part of anyone's anatomy... shorter in front and i have a short torso. the fabric is nice and lightweight.
0,The one i tried on had something wrong with the pockets... one was regular height t eh other was so low  i could barely put my hand in it. however  the jumpsuit itself is really pretty and soft. color is nice  but hard ot pull off on pale skin like me.  i tried on the xs  but that was big. i would need xxs p if it was made in that size  so i let it go... (looked nice with pinched fabric in the back.    for reference i am 115 lbs  30 dd< 26.5 in waist.
1,The fabric is lovely and the straight leg cut makes these pants a great option for summer. they do run small.
