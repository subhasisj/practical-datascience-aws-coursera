-1,"Ref: 5'4""  125# 27/4  32g. i don't think this is for us shorter women. this hits you right where you don't want a vertical line to hit. it flares out at your hip and makes you look shorter than you are. the fabric is like a double gauze and very soft and the colors are beautiful but i couldn't even dream of making this work. i thought maybe with my larger bust it would create shape but it looks like i just wrapped a bunch of fabric around me! glad i tried in-store and didn't online order."
0,"I'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. i ordered a m and it was far too boxy and long in the arms as well as the back. the collar is small and lays flat. the material is good quality and soft but heavier than i had hoped."
1,These are my favorite flare jeans! they have that lovely 70's style and go with everything and look great all year round. the fit is perfect. my all time favorite jeans.
-1,I really fell in love with this shirt. i am about 5 4 and 110 pounds. i ordered xxs which that was a good size from the chest but this shirt is literally so wide  i was ready to fly. although the model wears this shirt really nicely  i think this shirt is made for a certain type of body. not quite sure what that is.... also this shirt is shorter than what i expected. it looks a lot longer on the model. i had to return this shirt.
-1,I see all the amazing reviews and on one hand  i agree with them. but these pants do run huge and they don't fit tailored like on the model. on me  they fit loose around the legs and thighs and they're super wrinkly. you'll have to iron these after every wear and every wash. i'm surprised to see the comment saying they're wrinkle resistant. they aren't. also  the kahki is more grey which i don't love. i got these on sale  but even at $50 i just can't justify keeping them. they're super comfy but
1,This sweater is very cute. i got a medium  i'm broad in the shoulders and a 34c. i wanted it a little loose. threw it over a tshirt and was not itchy at all. i feel it is light weight and perfect for our mild winters in florida. can't wait till the weather cools down to wear it.
0,I was so excited to receive this in the mail as it had been on backorder for awhile. the dress is beautiful  but run smalls the buttons on the back are nearly impossible to fasten. if you are single  good luck trying to get it buttoned. i'll be returning it.
0,This top is very pretty  but it doesn't make up for the problems with it. retailer seems to be suffering from quality issues as of late. the sizes are all over the place and items i have purchased don't seem to hold up to normal use and washing. i normally wear a medium in tops. the medium in this top was huge. i needed an extra small  which means a lot of people are sized out of this top. i hand washed this top in cold water as the tag indicated and it shrunk! it shrunk so much that i can
-1,Really cute piece  but it's huge. i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering. returning.
1,So soft. a casual tunic  yet polished and interesting enough for work. darker blue than the photo  and the colors are much brighter and prettier in person.
-1,I was looking for a dress for playing cello at my friend's wedding. the colors looked perfect  the cut was great  etc. very disappointed to find out how sparkly and scratchy the dress was in person  and sad that the slit came right to my knee  which is a really weird height. sadly returning - might purchase again if it goes on sale and i can't find anything better before the wedding :(
0,"I am 5' 8""  145 pounds with a 32 ddd bust. i typically purchase a small or a 4 to 6 in blouses. this blouse was small across the chest and therefore  i purchased a size 8. it is a nice fit. however  the button placement on the blouse does not work well for someone who is chesty. one button is placed slightly above bust line and the other slightly below. this causes a peek-a-boo space between buttons. therefore  i wear a bright white tank top beneath the blouse and wear the blouse unbuttoned to j"
1,I buy everything that retailer sells in chambray. this top did not disappoint. it is so comfortable and the back the way it is slightly lower than normal is very sexy without being revealing. the straps fall off of your shoulders a bit but i do not find it annoying. i am not big busted so i didn't have the sizing issue that others seemed to have.
0,"It made me look extra thick in the middle--could pass for maternity wear. pretty colors. fabric is fine. it's just too shapeless and not flattering on me. i'm 5'11"" and it was also on the short side for me. even if it fit better  probably too short for my age (40s)."
-1,An awful dress! retailer why didn't you post my last review. i would not even give it a quarter of a star.
-1,Buttons were broken off when i opened the package  stretchy at waist  not good quality for the price.
1,"This chemise is very pretty in person. when i tried it on  i was surprised to find that it looks more like a sundress than a chemise. the material is kind of thin  but if you wear a nude colored bra underneath it  it won't show. it looked super cute with a denim jacket on. i took my normal size s and it fits perfectly (for reference  i am 5'2""  34b  120lbs). i am very happy with this purchase  and i can't wear it as a chemise  a coverup  or a hot day sundress. highly recommended!"
1,I thought i'd be the first to review for non -size- small ladies... i'm usually between a large and xl in retailer.  the large was great.. with room   as this top is pictured.  you'll love the details on this colorful  fun top ( ex: buttons on the side).  great with skinnies. i bought it on sale  but it really is a special top and worth the price.
0,"This dress arrived today in such a crumpled and wrinkled state that i was reluctant to even try it on. it is on the large size  but fine if you are looking for a very flowing look. longer at the front than shown in the photograph and i am 5'9"". i am sending it back. it is a pretty fabric  although shinier than expected. i am just not prepared to spend so much time pressing and steam ironing this item every time i want to wear it."
0,The purple/cobalt is a beautiful color. i feel the t shirt material is entirely too thin for the price.
0,Purchased this should in the blue motif in size small. i am usually between a small and medium in shirts  36c broad shoulders. the fit was fine in the small. however  i had a few issues with the top: 1) the blue motif looked actually like a faded blue (as if it had been washed quite a few times and looked worn)  2) the front mid/bottom section laid strangely and gave me a maternity look  and 3) the back has alot of fabric (see back of tank in white motif) and was very voluminous. for me  it wasn
-1,"I am typically a small/6 in dresses  but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down. it had no shape  but hung like a paper sack. the armholes fit perfectly though  if i had sized down they may have been too tight. i am 5'6"" 140 lb  i will return  too bad because it is a pretty dress!"
1,Beautiful and comfy!!!! love it!
1,I have not worn yet but excited to try it out soon with jeans and boots. comfy but has a nice sweater look...not too casual. sleeves are very long but don't think i want to downsize.
-1,The colors on this kimono are amazing and i really loved it  however  i too noticed the 'delicateness' of the material. it is so delicate that parts were starting to fray - including next to the kimono's label. so sad.
1,I held my breath as i slid this on for the first time right out of the package; the size 8 was perfect for me (usual medium  size 8  short-waisted  34f)! this blouse is truly a find: luxurious linen in a unique  appealing design  excellent fit (the pleat at the back gives nice room to make the fit just right  the v-neck is not too deep (thankfully bra friendly!)  the slightly lower back length is stylish but not extreme  and finally  admirable craftsmanship. i highly recommend! this will feel di
0,I fell in love with this dress the instant i saw it. but was disappointed when i received it. first was the color. i chose the green and it wasn't what i thought. it was a very unnatural shade of artificial grass. when my husband saw it in the package he thought i had ordered a cheap grass hula skirt. the color was that bad. the fit was the next problem. this dress would have fit nicely if they had just added a side zip and made the top more fitted. the top was loose and that added to the flowy
-1,I tried on this top and it looked fine until i tried to move. you can't lift your arms. i tried on a larger size but still felt like the movement was limited in the back and arm areas.
-1,I was so excited to get this in the mail... and loved everything about it except for the fact that it was only as long as one inch above my navel! i don't know why it looks like a normal length on the model. im returning it.
1,I really like how this fits. it is soft and the eyelet details are very cute.
0,"I so wanted to love this dress! the color and fabrics are beautiful and scream summer! i was so disappointed by the fit through. the different fabrics are such a cool concept but it wasn't executed that well. one material is pleated like an accordion so wants to ""constrict""  the next material is crocheted so is a little more stiff and the third material is pretty average. on the bottom where it's flowy it doesn't make that much of a difference  but on top and in the middle it gives this weird ""i"
-1,So i'm not sure if its just my body type or what  but this did nothing for me. the bottom  which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium (i'm a size 8 bottom) and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose. i just think this one is going to take the right body type. it could look really beautiful on the right person  just not me.
1,Like the other reviewers said  it has a lot of bulky fabric if you wear it as pictured. i tried it on and tied the string around the back so it's an open vest. i love if!
0,I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn't even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color  it's really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out.
0,After reading other reviews i ordered a small. my usual size is a m. it was huge all around. it's a beautiful print but i think it would make a nice maternity top.
1,Love these. wearing them today with a longer tunic style denim shirt and cardigan and boots. nice subtle print. i think they run about 1 size small. i'm normally a size 0/25. the xs was a bit snug and the material stretched so you could see white around the seams where the print pulled. size s fits great without any pulling and waistband comes up far enough. incidentally  i like them so much bought the same leggings in plain black elsewhere and the size s was the best fit in those too. love love
-1,I wanted to love this dress so much so that i ignored earlier reviews and purchased it in two sizes to see if i could make it work. the fabric is gorgeous  but the fit was very unflattering. it's too large on top and hangs awkwardly in both sizes. i considered tailoring to make it work but with this pattern i felt like that would be a compromise. in the end i returned both sizes ast the fabric couldn't compensate for the very unflattering fit.
-1,I wanted to love this sweater. the lavender color and design with the pleated back was beautiful. however when i put it on  it added at least 20 pounds to my frame. unfortunately it's going back since the cut just doesn't work on my frame.
1,"I am 5'4""  170lbs  34dd and a medium fits beautifully in this top. the mint green is very pretty  and a nude bra under it works without showing and without it being see-thru. it is super soft and pretty  and doesn't cling. i love it!"
1,This is a great light  free flowing top for the summer. i agree with the other reviewers that the top section hits in a weird area  but if you are small busted  you won't be affected. it can be dressed up or down with jewelry and offers a whimsical option to a plain white blouse for the summer!
1,Absolutely love this in blue. the cut and fit are flowy while still having a flattering shape. the colors and pattern are accurate on screen - vibrant and rich. the tie front is a pretty detail allowing the top to feel a little dressy. very happy with this purchase!
-1,Don't even waste your money  even on sale.    bought three in different colors because i loved the loose fit and airyness for hot southern summers. unfortunately  one of them ripped in the first wash. i let it air dry and thats when i found multiple runs and a hole that i could put my finger through. one of the other colors was fine  yet still pilled pretty bad. the third one still has the tag. keeping the one that survived the wash because i like the color - but will only be using it as a knock
-1,"Runs very large and way too much fabric. i wanted this top to work because it looks cute on hanger. i usually wear s/m and the xs had too much fabric. may work better on someone with longer torso and taller. i am 5'6.5"" 36c 126lbs"
0,I loved the look of this top when i saw it online  however  when i received it i was kinda disappointed. the color of the top was different than what i perceived initially. .it's way more off white. ..not my favorite. the texture/pattern of fabric on the body of the top was too near hanky for me. the sequin detail at neckline is wonderful  but not enough for me to keep. unfortunately i will be returning this one. not a hit for my desired as the tic but some one else might love!
-1,This is huge. i understand that's the style  but it looked like i was wearing my husband's size xxl. i tried to imagine a really cold day when all that extra fabric would be nice... but then it started to itch  and itch and itch!
-1,I was so excited to get this dress. i need it for a wedding  and i thought i had hit the jackpot. the dress arrived with a small tear. the seams are puckered and badly seen.  for an almost $300.00 dress  the quality is terrible. i expect better from retailer. i'm so disappointed.
0,I ordered two of these  the grey and ivory. i have had great luck with jackets and blazers from retailer. these were the exception. i just could not pull them off. the quality was great but they had little shape except being a bit boxy. i do have wider hips. maybe these would look better on someone tall and thin? for reference  i am 5'6 and about 138lbs. i ordered smalls and the sizing was perfect for me  the style was just off. i had to return both.
1,"This dress is so much better in person! i got the petite size (i am 5'2"") and it seems to run a bit smaller than the regular size- i have a fairly large bust so i went up a size and it seems to fit perfectly. love the colors and vintage design! i can't wait to wear it for a wedding i will be attending!"
0,"Purchased because i wanted a deep red sweater  and this one was the perfect color. unfortunately i am on the curvier side  with 34g chest  155lbs 5' 5""  and the med was too big  (i usually wear m or l at retailer.) also the fit ended up being boxy on my body type."
0,I really like the color of this and the feel  but that is where it ends. it does not come with the gorgeous flattering belt that it is pictured with  and is cut without shape so it does not fit to your body and show off any glorious womanly curves. i could purchase the belt with it  but i don't prefer to purchase products that cannot stand on their own.
1,I love the loose vibe of this top. the bold stripes are super cute. i can dress this up or wear with jeans and sneakers. get this top ladies!
-1,I ordered a size large  however as a large  my chest is large as well. this nighty barley covered me (in the chest region). the rest of the body fit well.
0,"I love the pattern and style of this top. it is a flattering cut  however  it was way too short. i am 5'6"" and small usually fits me without issue. sadly enough i had to return it."
-1,Nice quality fabric and design  but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange. wanted to love it but sadly sent it back
-1,This dress looked gorgeous in the monthly catalog. ordered in hopes to wear in easter. i felt it was frumpy and just ok. color was pretty but overall; i didn't love it like i hoped to.
0,"Nice weight and loved the design  but the inside was what i loved the most. it doesn't show in the photos  but the zipper is a light blue and the fabric is double-sided  so the inside is lined with light blue flowers on a darker blue background. cute detail! the only drawback was the length of the sleeves. they were about 2"" too long...and i have long arms! there wasn't enough stretch in band of the sleeve to keep them up once you pushed them up. the only other option i came up with was to fold"
1,This is a beautiful and super soft cashmere sweater. i found it to run large  so thankfully i ordered one size down  which was perfect. i'm normally xs  but the xxs was very flattering  still loose and casual  but fitted in the waist and arms. it is longer in length and hit mid to lower hip on my petite frame. the regular was fine  but a petite would probably be great. the sleeves are nice and long and have a pretty lace stitch detail. the cowl is nice  not too overwhelming. this is so soft and
-1,I ordered online. i sized up one size. it fit perfect. so flattering and so pretty. then i tried to take it off and the zipper stuck...badly. 30 minutes later i was sadly packing it up to ship back. the zipper is that awful.
0,"I'm still on the fence with this shirt. i have the grey - it almost looks like a cheetah design up close. i'm 5'3"""
1,"I love his cardigan! i knew the small would be a little big since i am normally an xs or xxs. i decided to give it a try anyway. it's definitely a little big - i would have liked an xs to be an option (5'3"" and 110lbs  for reference). i'm keeping it because it still looks cute  just a little loose through the body."
-1,I was so excited to order this top - it looked like it was made of more sturdy  soft cotton  but sadly after receiving it today i found that to not be true. it's incredibly sheer - you'd have to wear a cami underneath  which defeated the point for me. the pleating in the front hides your bra  but you can see it from all other angles (i tried it on with an unlined nude lace bra  which can easily hide under sheer clothing). i was hoping to be able to wear it on its own without a cami and for it to
1,"Upon entering a local retailer store  i saw this top almost instantly and decided to try it on.   fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back  high waist  5'3"" (almost)  and i normally wear a 12 in a fitted  button-up shirt. i can go down to a 10 in a loose-fit one  but with the buttons i wouldn't expect this to be ""loose-fitting"". i wear a m or l in a knit top. i tried this on in 12  but it was too big in the armholes and chest  causing the top to stand out too much from my body. when i tried on the 10  these"
0,This top has too much fabric! i would of liked it more if they had a smaller size but the small seemed like a medium or large!
0,I bought this on sale thinking it was a great deal  but when it came in i found it to fit like a totally unflattering sack. the pattern didn't help anything  looking totally faded and washed out...the fabric and overall quality is nice  but the fit and pattern are just so..ugly  unfortunately. had to return it.
1,Easy to wear and very cute  especially for curvy ladies. but  i think it looks best worn with a best  or a blazer on top  something to emphasize the waist a bit more.
0,"I really thought i would love this dress the style is really nice and the material is great. however  the length made me feel like i looked short and kind of stumpy. i feel like this dress would look really good on somebody that is more like 6ft  not my 5'6"" self."
0,I waited impatiently for this item to come in stock  and when it did  i had it overnighted because i was so excited to receive it. it's hit or miss with me as far as retailer's mediums and larges  depending on the brand. i generally err on the side of caution  so i ordered the large. it looked cute out of the package  but when i put it on i was terribly disappointed. it flared way out at the bottom  and was not as fitted through the waist as on the model. this could have been the large sizing  but
0,This is a flattering  comfortable  soft sweater the instant you put it on. a few instants after that  however  i found mine had relaxed a great deal to become baggy  and pilled even more to become a fuzzy wuzzy monstrosity. i'm not optimistic about its longevity and wouldn't recommend it except for the extravagant single-use buyer.
1,This is a really cute skirt  and it seems well-made (good stitch-work and enough weight to the fabric that i'm not worried about underwear show-through but not too heavy for a summer skirt). i sized up from an 8 to a 10 because it was difficult to get the skirt over my bum. also  the zipper doesn't lay flat when i have it in the back of the skirt so i just shifted it to the side--still looks great imo. i think if you have hips or a booty you might want to size up on this skirt. color is true to
-1,I agree with the reviewer that said this product photo is misleading! you can't possibly wear this sweater off the shoulder as pictured! it does however provide a great fit  i sized down from large to medium...and the brown color is really pretty!
1,"Saw this in the store and immediately liked it. when i tried it on  i loved it. colors are muted  and the style is very flattering. the fabric drapes nicely but is not too heavy  which is perfect for me to wear all through winter in the south. length is perfect for me (5'8""). it does look great off the shoulders  but i also think it can be worn up on the shoulders for a more work-appropriate look. it does run slightly large. i wear a large  but went with a medium in this one so it wouldn't be to"
1,I ordered top and pants online as seen. pants are of good quality and hang beautiful.  i love the color and quality of the fabric. nice and vibrant. nice fit at the top into a flowy drape. the top runs big and glad i ordered down one size. love the outfit for my upcoming island trip.
