1,"I bought this to give room for an expanding tummy - i'm 6 months pregnant and this completely conceals the bulge.  i suspect i will appreciate that in the spring when i'm actually trying to hide my leftover belly... it's incredibly soft and the top is wide enough to cover a bra strap.  the arm holes are small enough to cover my parts but large enough to be comfy.  i'm 5'5""  medium build and normally wear a medium but got a large given my circumstances.  a medium would have probably worked normal"
0,It looks so cute and i love the detail on this dress but it was not flattering on me. light summer dress and that was exactly what i needed but i had to exchange it with something else.
1,"I tried it on and it fit like a glove. i'm only 5'2"" and i can wear with heals or flats. great built in bra. i'm a c cup and i've got a bubble butt. very flattering on my figure. quality worth every penny. many compliments. work appropriate or a luncheon! my fav retailer purchase by far."
-1,My v-shape figure (broad shoulder  narrow hips  waist not well defined) looked completely square in this. not flattering at all. perhaps better for other figures.
1,Great buy. i bought the cream jumpsuit.  i'm small on bottom and larger on top. this was perfect  shouldn't fit tight  should flow  has lots of room  it is linen  adjustable buttons on front and adjustable on the back of jumpsuit. legs are wide and flowy. casual but classy. both sides have about 3 buttons at hips. great addition to any closet. unique in its own right.
-1,I was very disappointed with my recent retailer order. i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front. i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric. sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition. very disappointing.
0,I am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40. i did not purchase this top.
1,These jeans are beautiful. as the other reviewers have noted...they run very large...like 2 sizes  even then they are very stretchy. the embroidery is dark blue (looks black on screen)....lovely pair of jeans. if they had other colors i would by them!
0,I purchased these in large which is normally my size on bottom. they are a little roomy and the waist is so high on me that i am going to tack the waist down. they are ok. good quality but not the best pants in the world.
0,I love the feel and quality of these pants  however  they ran super big! they would not stay up around my waist  unfortunately.
-1,This dress looks amazing on-line. in person the arm ruffles are much larger and stick out  and the dress at the bottom makes you look like strawberry shortcake. too much all over ruffling at the chest and is not flattering. pattern is dizzying in person.     very thin multi layer dress. should be better material and quality for this price. save your money and shipping.
-1,I couldn't wait to try this on this sweater.  sadly  it was too large in all ways.  the sleeves are adorable  but the ruffle overwhelmed my arms. this was much longer on me than the model.  it stopped mid-thigh.  the quality seemed fine  but it is a thin sweater.
-1,Usually wear s and xs  tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up. if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight. the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low. it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way. two layers  green on outside  and a polyester beige layer underneath.  but definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket.
-1,The fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue grey...condensation drips from a glass  gel deodorant  etc. i tried the cream but it's very sheer. i had to return this dress-- not practical!
-1,I like my dresses oversized but this one is ridiculous. it's seriously unflattering. i usually between a m & a l and i got a small and it's still massive. but the slip is tiny.     it looks so cute in the picture. but not good in person.
0,As a petite  big busted woman  i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful  though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however  i found unflattering.
1,I love seafolly boyleg bathing suits. i find them very flattering and just universally appealing. this one has beautiful summery design as well. i found it to be running slightly smaller than plain colored editions of this suit. i normally wear size 6 (us size) of this suit  but this particular design 6 was too small and had to exchange for 8(us) which fits perfect.
0,This runs really big. i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out. i don't have a store close by (about an hour away) and i hate paying shipping for returns! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone. i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though!
-1,I was bummed about this top. detail on back is pretty  even so  not worth it. i'm usually an xs i'm  120 lbs and it fit true to size. guess i had higher expectations. i'm feel consistently let down with what the pictures convey and the actual item when it arrives in person...
-1,"I ordered this in a size 1 which i thought would be a small and it was very  very wide. it is very short too. i typically wear a small and am 5'8"" and 132 lbs. it's going back unfortunately. very soft material though."
0,The top as with most of ap's tops is well stitched. material is very uncomfortable. if you have large bust it is a little divulging. this may prompt you to wear something underneath to look modest and change the shape of the top!
-1,I really wanted to like this because the color is beautiful and the knit is obviously good quality. but the shape is impossible to work with. it doesn't just run big  it just hangs there. really disappointing. it'll have to go back.
-1,"I really wanted to love this dress. i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors  and thought that the green color would be perfect. it is well made  but the fabric is lighter than expected. the biggest issues was the size. i am 5'7"" and typically a size ten. i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge. if you order this  i would say size down two sizes."
1,This sweet dress is perfect for fall and spring because the knit is not too thick  the drape allows layers and the colors are very versatile.  the style is loose if you stay tts but will be a slimmer fit if you size down.  if your body habitus is super slender  definitely size down.  the liner slip is soft and the back side of the knit is a bit scratchy.  i think this dress is beautiful and best of all  forgiving.  i'm happy to have tried both colors--the problem is picking which one to keep!  m
0,I loved the blue brocade since it's a little unusual  paired with a top that brings an otherwise formal fabric into something you could wear out to dinner  plus a little pop of extra color from the ribbon! my biggest fear ordering online was that the top would look cheap - fortunately it doesn't. the top of the dress was fitted (i wore my usual size). what i didn't expect  though  is the skirt is really poofs out a lot below the ribbon  which runs just below the bust. the photo online shows a li
0,I ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom. it is too pricey to live up to my expectations. it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you can't see in the pictures. this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap. it is made of viscose and dry clean only. the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion. if it had been real silk or another natural fiber  ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me.
1,This feels and looks like a ballet skirt on  so light and flowy  super comfortable  just love it! extremely flattering cut  tiny gathered folds at waistband add pretty detail and create a slimming effect on my tummy  what's not to love?! great pockets too! i have a 34 inseam and the length is perfect. ordering in both colors now as i can see these becoming my go to bottoms all summer long....
1,I love this sweater. it is so soft and the pink is such a sweet shade. it is large and falls of the shoulder  but that's how it is designed to fit. it is my new favorite sweater!
-1,The fit on this shirt is bizarre--it very much resembles a nursing top (but wouldn't actually work for that purpose). the side visible in the picture is nicely draped  but the other side can flap open and is completely different. i tried two different sizes and both were equally unfortunate!
1,I received this dress yesterday and it exceeded expectations! i was not expecting the fabric to have a slight stretch and felt that the fabrication aided to the overall comfort of the dress without losing any of the quirky elegance. due to the stretch  however  i immediately ordered a size down for comparison. i'm a pretty solid 2 with eva franco dresses but with this cut i had about an inch of fabric in the waist. regardless  i'm keeping the dress - jury is just still out on which side!! measur
0,I took a chance on this top because i liked the style. i prefer natural fibers like cotton and linen. this is rayon and spandex. sure  why not at least give it a shot and go outside my box?! if the fabric would have been my preference  it would have been a keeper. i did not like the feel  nor the semi-sheer quality. maybe it would work for you  but not for me. back it went.
-1,Material is awful. not soft at all. colors are much darker than shows online. it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model. it went back.
0,"The material  deep color and design are gorgeous. however  the dress is just too bulky for my 5'2"" and 110lb frame. i ordered a 0p  and it just wasn't flattering on me. it's somewhat tent-shaped so the fact that it's not at all fitted and has a thick lining made me look larger than i actually am. i'm so disappointed because the dress really is beautiful otherwise."
0,Like others  i was drawn to the collar  fabric and overall look to it....  ________  pros:  - thicker fabric so it hides lumps and bumps well.  - collar is so classy  but i am drawn to anything with a collar.  - pockets are a nice touch.  _______  cons:  - thicker fabric and polyester = got hot rather quickly in it.  - runs a tad small if you have hips. there was only a medium at the store to try on and it fit everywhere but the hips; it just didn't flare out much for me being hourglass. a large
1,Bought these pants for a long trip through south east asia. tried them on at home and instantly fell in love with the relaxed yet styled look. will be incredibly versatile on my trip which i need as i am bringing only ~15 pounds of luggage including the bag. they seem breathable and are light weight. super flattering as they are slightly slimming and don't bunch up at the waste. i got the greenish color.
0,I live in ny and bought his coat for the winter  thinking since it was made out of wool it would be warm. this coat is extremely thing  more like a spring/fall coat and therefore i don't think the price justifies the quality. i am going to return and consider repurchasing if it goes on sale. i also wish it had a button or way of keeping it closed rather than just hang loosely.
-1,I was really excited about this dress- the style looked like it would be a spring/summer staple in my retailer-heavy wardrobe. i was really surprised when i received it in the mail. the dress is quite thin cotton fabric and feels cheaply made. for the price  i could purchase a much higher quality dress elsewhere that would hold up better. i've been an retailer fan for more than an decade  but this trend of higher prices for lower quality is disappointing and insirpring me to leave a review for the f
0,Lovely knit and so soft  but the bottom curls up underneath  similar to the bell sleeves. runs oversize too  got xs and it's too bulky and unflattering since the bottom doesn't lay flat. returned!
-1,"Too thin at bottom where lace is.  couldn't sit in the dress without worrying i was ""hanging out"""
0,Ordered it because i am fan of floral dresses. i found that colors are not as bright as pictured  overall color looks beige in real life. fabric has nice weight  not too heavy nor too light  it is not itchy  but not very soft either. good dress for colder weather. the sizing was right  i got my usual m and i am 5'10'' 145lb. the dress has a side zipper  but i did not need it. the dress is slimming and close to the body. the cut did not work for me: sleeves were too short  i had to pull them up t
1,"I love a good gaucho/ culotte. these are very comfortable and fit is tts (i'm 5'9"" 145 and wear a 29). they are ironed with a line down the front  which i don't like  as it's always hard for me to keep the ironing straight. the pants have a little bit of stretch to them which is nice. since they're linen  they will require frequent ironing (which  i hate to do in the summer)."
0,Love this top   although it ran very small in bust and arms   i'm normally a medium will have to return for a large!
0,This is a gorgeous dress. i got the red version. it's stunning...the zipper is trash however. i'm scared of getting stuck in it like another reviewer.
-1,Terrible fit for a longer torso.  runs small in hip and lining  huge in the waist.  not good for an hourglass figure!
0,"I had really high hopes for this dress  and i am still unsure if i'll keep it or not. i ordered both a small and a medium because i was unsure of this brand. the small fit (i""m usually a 4 s/m at retailer - 34b  140 lb  5'8"") just like it does on the model  only the photo online gives the illusion that this is a slight fit-and-flare dress. this is a shift with pleating subtleties on the bustline that bring it in slightly. also  the colors should be more like ""blue multi"" because there's a bright a"
0,I love the looks of this sweater on the model! after receiving it  it was still very pretty and stylish to look at. my problem is that i am petite  and the sweater seemed to run very large. it wasn't very fitted. i think the detailing in the back would look better fitted. it made me look rather dowdy and/or matronly unlike how it looks on the model. i think that was because it was just too big. i returned it.
1,Beautiful lace shell! great with jeans for a night out  or with a skirt for a more formal affair. good quality  not itchy.
1,Pretty delicate lace top...love it! hits right at waist so not unflattering at hips.
1,"The fit and design are interesting. in the 00p  the fit was good though the dress was not easy to get into or out of - strategy required. the quality is fine. but the color was very ""blah "" with too little of the bright stripes in an otherwise rather dull color scheme. that made the dress overall feel too busy and rather confused. with the lining and material weight  it would be more a cold weather item only  not an all seasonal dress.  generally  it was interesting but not a ""most come home wit"
1,I received this in the mail today and i liked it from the minute i tried it on and looked in the mirror. it is a unique piece to compliment black pants or jeans. i hope to be able to wear it with leggings if it covers my bum so i will have to try it on with leggings to see. the fabric is nice and it fits well and compliments my figure. it is longer as it appears on the model. i do recommend you give it a try especially at the sale price!
-1,I bought this top in two colors--i think it's a really cute  easy top to wear  but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality. i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming  which i'm sure will be a hole in no time. two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally  i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears.
0,I purchased this shirt in grey. i loved the color and the details  especially the lace on the shoulders. i just found the fit to be off for me. the style certainly calls for a relaxed fit but the small was loose in an unflattering way. had the xs been available i might have considered exchanging for an xs but the s was already a bit short on me. (strange because although i am not petite  i am fairly short wasted.) i also wasn't in love with the neckline. i will continue my search for a weekend-w
-1,I saw this dress and loved everything about it! i was so sad when i tried it on and it was just too big. they were out of the smaller size  so i had to return it. the dress is well made and the color is just a bit neon compared to the picture.
1,I saw this in an email and loved it but by the time i tried to order it that evening  some sizes were already gone. the medium was back-ordered but didn't have to wait too long to receive it.. i especially like the design with the full skirt. the material is light weight  which is prefect for my florida climate. the design and fit were beautiful!!! i love it and will get years of use out of it. my only complaint is the material wrinkles very easily. i tried to get them out myself but ended up se
1,"Super soft and cute. the buttons add a nice touch. the color depicted online gave me pause  but when i saw it in the store it was more of a blue than that what you see in pic. great investment. beautiful sweater. 34c  65""  135 and the small is perfect."
0,The regular length i tried on in store definitely didn't work for me. for reference in the photos i have a medium on and my measurements are 38-30-40.
-1,I thought this dress looked gorgeous on the model. so floaty and light. when it came  i found it to be the exact opposite. the hem is so heavy and laid on me like a potato sack. it had way too much material at the bottom and weighed me down unfortunately.
0,I had such high hopes for this top. it is beautiful but it is very uncomfortable! the lace/beadwork is extremely itchy. the button at the neck seems cheap and i was worried it would fall off. the beadwork and lace puckered on my shoulders making the fit off for me.
0,O.k. i soo wanted to love this dress. if you are slim and small chested it is true to size and lovely. i am slim and tall 5'9 but am large chested. a 36d i usually wear an 8/10 so bought a 10. it was too tight around my chest and back. so i went up a size to a 12. it was better but not exactly comfortable. i could get away with it but for the price had to send it back. the idea of going up another size yet again was a thought but i worried it wouldn't solve my issue.
-1,I grabbed my typical size (8) and found it fit snug in the bust. the fabric has plenty of stretch  so the snugness was fine  especially because it meant there was no gaping along the neckline in the front. it's lowcut  but i didn't feel particularly exposed. i ended up not buying it because i don't think it fit my body right. the distance between the top of the shoulder and the bottom of the arm hole was too long for me - a significant portion of my bra was exposed at the bottom of the arm hole
-1,The color is darker than shown (i ordered the denim looking one). the flower things are not very visible as it all looks one color. it must be great for the tall skinny model   but if your 5'4'' and pear shaped like me  it's a no go! took it back to my local store.
-1,Wanted to love this colorful romper. the fabric was suuuuper thin and very cheap feeling and looking. no way would i wear this.
1,So glad i was able to snag these killer 70's-ish flares. they are super cool at a nice length. love the button detail. i ordered these in my current size and they fit right out of the box. love them so much.
1,"I have the marrakech vest from the summer and really liked the quality and fit of that  so i ordered this one. fit is very similar. this one is made of a lightweight cotton  and has a similar cut. will be a great fall transitional jacket  and looks great with lots of things--maxi skirts  skinny jeans  long tops with the hems peaking out  etc. i found it tts: i got an xs and am 5'4""  120 lbs. i don't plan to wear more than a thin top underneath  but don't think i could fit a sweater under the sle"
0,I wanted to love this dress because the fit is so flattering and the color is so great however i could not get the button along my bust to lay flat. normally this can happen if the fit is too tight around the bust but i promise there was still plenty of room. the fabric just bent in a way that left a gaping hole at my bust. unfortunately it's going to have to go back.
1,Women who want some flutter without too much fullness
-1,"I ordered this in my usual size small (36b bust  5'5""  around 116 lbs)  but the seam around the high waist stuck out and didn't cinch in at the waist at all  rather bubbled out a bit. the tunic ""flaps"" laid strangely as well  like they were too small almost. the high cut sides were indeed high cut...showing the waistband of my leggings. apparently that is a new style  as i have seen a few other tops like it around  but i question whether slits that high are appropriate for actual wear outside on"
-1,I've been buying stevie ankles for years from retailer and been very happy. the past two pairs i bought had a heavy chemical smell  which i imagine is some kind of starch/chemical to keep the denim stiff. with the first pair  after enough washes to get rid of the bad smell (4)  they lost all form and looked terrible since they were washed i couldn't return them. the 2nd pair arrived with the same heavy smell and i returned them. it may be they are made elsewhere now  but it's disappointing.
1,I love this shirt! it's such a beautiful striking color  yet still simple enough to not take the spotlight. the peekaboo shoulders are totally cute. i bought another one of these when it went on sale. so now i have two just in case;) haha
1,"This picture does not do this blouse justice. the material is velour where the flowers are and there's a bit of sparkle. i'm generally a pl in other stores and bought a m and was pleased. it's true to size. i'm 5'1"" and the regular length was perfect and not too long at all. i won't have to shorten it. the blouse will look great with skinny jeans and boots or the right long flowy skirt. it can easily be worn to a dressy occasion. it's gorgeous!!"
1,"I have a casual oceanside wedding to attend and thought this easy  yet elegant dress would be a good purchase. i initially bought two sizes: 10 and 12. i'm typically a 12 in more structured dresses (i.e.  more rigid fabric with zippered entry) but because this dress was flowy and slipped on over the head  i also ordered the 10. i'm 5'5""  broader shoulders  36d  with smaller hips that are typically one size smaller than my top half. the 12 ended up being comically huge and fit like a tent. the 10"
1,"I got a size xxsp which is perfect although i usually wear a xs petite or xs. i'm 5'2""  currently 33-25-37  30d/32c bra  with narrow shoulders and torso  a bit long-waisted. the ribbed darby sweater hugs every single curve without being tight. low cut  but not as low as on the model; very flattering neckline. sleeves end about an inch above my elbows and can be folded up.  .  well made  very lightweight knit of 57% cotton  43% polyester. the ribbing detail is very well thought out. there is bias"
