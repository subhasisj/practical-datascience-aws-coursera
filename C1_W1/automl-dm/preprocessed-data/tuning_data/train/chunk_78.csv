1,I ordered this top in the grey along with the white lace up back pocket tee. while the other tee was totally see through and very poor quality  this one delivers in every way. in fact  i am sending the other one back to get this top in the ivory as well. the lace is very substantial and the fabric is not see through at all  like so many tops are these days. i ordered my usual medium and it comes down over my bum  just like i wanted to wear with leggings. i see this as a staple and this is my fir
1,The retailer store by me only carried these in the petites  but i've learned to always snag a petite just to see because sometimes the petites fit just as well  if not better  depending on the length of the outfit!  ______________  pros:  - looks exactly the same in person as online. color runs true.  - well made  good stitching  solid dress.  - great length in the sleeves.  - fits tts. i'm normally a size 10 or 12 and grabbed the 12p to see how it'd fit. other than being too short in length on my
1,This top is gorgeous in person! i'm in love with it! it's perfect for the holiday season. it runs a little big and long so i suggest going down a size for a more tailored fit.
-1,This looks so cute...but don't be fooled. it is so poofy. it does not look in real life like it does on the model. it poofs way out on the sides and looks ridiculous. i was so disappointed.
-1,"And the bottom looks like a tutu. first  i have high tolerance for scratchy fabric but this one i could feel it even through long sleeves. there is no way i could wear something that makes my skin itch so badly. second  the peplum part is huge and looks like an exaggerated skirt. finally  the color on the ""green one"" is darker than in the picture and it does have more of a green than blue tint. back it goes."
0,Very boxy top  not flattering on. i will be returning.
0,So  this is just the most lovely romper. beautifully made  flowey. very comfortable  until you have to take it off.  this is the review i posted on facebook.   so  no man i know has ever ever ever experienced the abject terror  or maybe has not shared with me  that moment when you cannot get out of  because it has turned into a straight jacket  that otherwise cute romper. and again  maybe a man invented it!
-1,I ordered my usual medium. the tops length came only to my waist  and was wide and unflatering.   the armholes were right under my arms. too bad as this looked so cute in the picture. i returned.
0,I ordered this in a size 4 and it is great quality. the only problem is the size of the slip. the top is very tight across my average chest  but fine elsewhere - odd fit. the dress fits great and i debated finding another slip  but ultimately decided to return it.
1,Have been looking for a motorcycle style sweater for a while and hit the jackpot with this one. i have a large 34g bust and it's hard to find one without overly large lapels. these are perfect and they stay down  which is hard to find too. perfect length  beautiful color. not too long in the back. it has zipper pockets and the photos don't show the silver grommets on each side at the hem. the body of the sweater has a different knit than the sleeves so it has a bit of that vest over sweater look
0,I love the design of this blouse and the pattern  but the colors are a bit darker than in the photo. the quality is pretty poor. i feel like its a snag away from being ruined and thrown away and for this price it is just not worth the purchase. sending it back :(   it comes with a tank top; just to let others know.
1,I visited my local retailer store to purchase a dress and left with two of these tunics.( i love browsing the retailer store  its a feast for my senses)the pavin buttyondown tunics are much more appealing in person.all three feel different due to their color and pattern. to me the burned orange feels like country and fall  the pastel grey one feels spring like and more elegant and the white one feels like summer. they all look very cute on.i did size down and still got the oversize flowing look.this
-1,Hi  when i received this top i tried it on  looked in the mirror and packed it up for a return. the quality is excellent but it just too boxy. fits nothing like it appears on the model.
0,This top is adorable in style and fit. which is why it breaks my heart that i can't recommend it. the embroidery snags so easily  when i wore it  i ended up with several tears in the threads  leaving the pattern a bit of a mess. it snagged on my rings  my watch and my purse. i returned it because of this. it's really too bad  and i wish the design were printed on instead of sewn  simply because it would last a lot longer.
0,Nice lines  just a bit tight if you have larger / more muscley shoulders.
0,I really wanted to love this sweater. the quality is good and it looks beautiful - until you need to lift your arms. i did end up keeping it but it is limited to when and where i can wear it due to the arm restrictions. i can see it in the picture but didn't notice until purchasing - the arm holes and right next to the bottom of the sweater. slight design flaw.
-1,I disliked this dress. it didn't fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured. i think it would work well for tall  thin women with a smaller chest. i am petite with a larger chest  and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time. not recommended for petite women.
1,I am a sucker for bows  so decided to try this one and ordered it. i went with the petite  without trying on the regular size (in hindsight  i should have ordered both)  but tit fit very nicely in petite  so keeping it. length is as on the model  right at hip  the colros of hte bow are well represented on the picture  light pink  light mustard yellow and navy  so i stil lthink it is neutral ebough to mix with other colors: warm or cold palette. love hte button detial in the back  i ordered xs an
-1,"Quality jumpsuit but poor design. the green made me look a bit like ""gumby the cartoon character"""
0,Love the top design  not so much the fabric. i should've read the top was 100% polyester. returning and finding a better quality top.
0,I really liked the fabric and look of this top  but i was swimming in fabric.  there was so much that the top felt heavy.  i returned it.
-1,This dress runs so large  why did they not make an extra small. the material and detail are great the flow in the back is different but is flattering. i wish wish that they made this in the extra small  i was swimming in it  there was no way to fix it so it went back
0,I purchased this sweater because of the cute unique diagonal design. however  i was largely disappointed by the fiber of the sweater  it is rather coarse to the touch and a bad fit. on the model it looks nice  but it was large around the torso  yet short at the same time creating an awkward and unflattering fit. i shall be returning it.
1,Just received my second pair of pilcro legging jeans; having bought them last year as well. great for work  girls night out  date night. so comfortable  with lots of stretch; fortunately they hold their shape and don't stretch out. they feel like pjs  but are nice enough for work. my pair from last year have held up well (color-wise)  however some of the leg seam stitching unraveled-- hence the reason for 4 stars in quality. hopefully  these will fare better.  regardless  i highly recommend!
-1,This is another one of those darned swing tops. i can't even with this trend. this shirt has such a nice print/color palette going on but it's ruined by the swing cut/henley combo- it looked like i was a little kid wearing an oversized men's night shirt/smock? i don't know  it was just not at all flattering. i ordered my regular size large and a medium would have worked and probably still been generously cut. i disagree with a reviewer who said it might work for larger sizes.. this just made my
1,I love this dress. i've received compliments from everyone. it's long enough to feel appropriate for work or teaching in sunday school - and  it's beautiful!
0,I had such high hopes for this jacket based on the photo  i even waited for it to come back in stock. the detail is beautiful but it is shapeless and boxy. for reference i ordered xs  and i am usually a 0/2 on top (small chested). it might look better on someone with a larger chest but looked like a sack on me. so disappointing.
-1,I love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their 25% off sale. i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress isn't even silk or a better material. but once i got this i was so disappointed  i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloon/tent on me. i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress. plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way. i don't even want t
-1,I want to be the person who lounges like the model...but this was huge and more wool-feeling than the lightweight shawl i was hoping for. i am an 8  got the xs/s it was the right size....i returned it.
0,The shirt is quite beautiful  the lace is thick and high quality. however  i have a short-ish torso and hourglass figure and this shirt added 20 lbs. the peplum fabric below the waist hung awkwardly and poofed out. maybe this would work better for a taller person  or one who has a straighter build.
-1,As the previous reviewer mentioned  the pockets ruin this dress. pockets  usually such a good idea! but here they're misplaced (right on the hips) and made of the same thick ponte fabric as the dress  so they stand out far from the body and completely ruin the line of the dress... not flattering to have huge gaping hip pockets. this makes an otherwise good dress a total loss.
-1,This is a beautiful skirt  but runs very small. i usually wear a size 8 and could not get the side zipper closed....at all.
1,I love this dress so much! i got petite and the length was perfect. it was so soft and so pretty. perfect for a wedding.
1,I love the neckline on this - sharp enough for work  but cute for a fun night out too. only complaint is it's soooo flowy on the bottom. i could hide a baby under here for sure. i got the medium thank goodness or it would have been ridiculous. i'm 5'8  160lbs. great for fall.
0,This is a well-made top and looks very pretty in the pictures  but in person it has a little more of a gauzy look to it. it is a great summer shirt as it is light and airy  but unfortunately it didn't work for me. i wear a 34c and that often results in shirts look more like tents or maternity wear than anything else. so  perhaps this works better for the smaller chested. additionally  and this wasn't so much of a con and just something to note  the fabric is pretty see-through. it works for the
-1,"So i really loved this dress. i am tall (6ft) and the size 8 was perfect length. i would have worn it with flat dressy sandals. i would say it is true to size. i am not a flowy dress kind of girl but this was just the perfect amount of ""flow"" without making me feel like i was wearing a long potato sack. the back is just gorgeous and unique. here is why i couldn't make it mine. the tube top part is completely detachable and extremely thin. there is literally not much to it and i'm not sure it wou"
-1,It's a cute idea  but it's so low cut and the material is very thin. i was hoping to wear it as a cool  flowing summer top  but i'll have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it. i'm only keeping it because it was such a good price. also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten.
-1,I loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable  however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body. it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections. bottom of pants are not hemmed  so if you want a clean look  you may not like the edges. these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me.
0,Bought this shirt in mid-july  washed twice (cold  delicate) and hung to dry. already holes/falling apart
-1,I wanted to love this shirt so much! i got this as a gift for christmas in the black. the first time i wore the shirt 3 of the buttons on the back fell off. keep in mind that they are not decorative and they held the shirt together. needless to say i was not so pleased to have my shirt fly open from the back. retailer and their amazing customer service took this shirt back no problem  but i wanted to give the fair warning!
1,Obsessed with this sweatshirt! it's a must have for any loungewear lover. i'm normally a xs but sized up to a s for a more loose  relaxed look. i was afraid it would swallow me  but i love the fit! the knot in the front is a nice detail that makes this comfy top really cute. the fabric is a great texture  great for transitioning from summer to fall and winter to spring. love everything about this sweatshirt and will easily pair with leggings or jeans. worth every penny!!!
1,"Ok  so this is adorable. i am 5'3"" and medium size and had to take this to my alterations people because i loved it so much but it fit awkwardly. the back was too long and hung funny on my short body. after it was reworked  it is the cutest thing i own. they also made the little belt tighter across my waist. it is super versatile. my alterations people ran out and bought themselves one after they saw mine. so---- if you are not a toothpick or tall know it can be amazing with a little attention."
0,I was excited to receive this top and wanted to love it; however  the side ruffles flared out more than i expected. it didn't look right on me so had to return it :(
1,I wasn't immediately attracted to this shirt  but decided to try it on. i loved it on!  it is comfortable and very flattering. i'm a small person  and the length wasn't overbearing on me. it was full  but the stitching around the chest gives it shape and is flattering to a smaller chested person. i'm not sure how it works on a fuller person  but my guess is it may surprise you!
0,I am pretty standard size 8  36c  5&amp;#39;6&amp;quot;  150 lbs. i ordered the small and the bust fit well but the whole thing was like a tent and way too flowy for my taste. it was also long so everything was very covered. i didn&amp;#39;t feel it flattered my build. i returned!
1,I've worn this shirt approx 3 times to work. each time someone comments on how much they like it. i'm attempting to add more color to my workwear. this shirt tends to swing so much i feel exposed. that is the biggest drawback.
1,I picked this up in the store during the retailer weekend sale. i used to have a similar long black stretchy skirt that i wore until it fell apart. things i really like about this skirt are that it's basic black  but has some interest in the small swiss dots in the top layer  and it's stretchy. the yoga-pant-waistband seems like it will be very comfy and also allows you to adjust the skirt length a little bit  depending on whether/how much you fold it down. it is lined  which is a big plus. i was
-1,This shirt was a cute print  but it was too boxy and hit too short on the thigh. i considered having it taken in the waist but ultimately decided it wasn't worth paying the extra $ on top of the $88
1,Overall i really like this dress. the color is vibrant & unique. the top of the dress especially the shoulder straps seem loose so i'm getting it tailored.
-1,I have been looking at this sweater online since it first came out and i finally ordered it when it was 40% off. i ordered a size m petite  sadly when it arrived and i tried it on  it was very boxy  stiff like  and did not flow like it looked on the model online so i sent it back.
0,Construction excellent. the dress was pretty big around the hip...does not have a shape like seen in the picture. the fabric was beautiful but was stiff...like furniture. the color was not as vibrant as the picture. returned.
1,"I am petite and curvy and was apprehensive about the cropped length of this jumpsuit. however  the petite looks great and the length is perfect. it is light enough weight to keep you cool during the day but provides some coverage for cool evenings. i ordered the xs petite and it was still a little loose. i am 5'3"" and 125lbs. this will be my go to for fall! looks great styled with ankle boots or clogs and will carry me into fall with a chunky sweater!"
-1,I loved this shirt when i got it. it fit perfectly  and was so soft. but when i washed it  following the instructions  it shrank up to well above my belly button. i'm talking 6 inches of shrinkage  at least.
0,This top is cute. i purchased a 2 instead of my usual size 4 and it fits well. i only recommend buying this top on sale. it is not good quality! there are loose threads hanging out of the seams all over the place and it is see through. it is totally nuts that it costs $88.
-1,This reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body. i'm thin and usually wear a size 0  so i'm not sure who this may look good on.
1,Great top  lately i've been sizing down from my usual xs to xxs with pure & good tops  but in this one the xs was best. i bought this in 3 colors and they're my go to tanks for summer. the mint is a bit sheer  but not bad. i did not get try the yellow or white one.
1,I already have some dresses similar to this  but i couldn't help getting this one  too. i love the flowers  bees  and ladybugs on the print! there is some shimmery beading on the neck and a few spots. i think i can wear this at work with the right cardigan/jacket  so i'll get more use out of it. it's a lovely light  floaty fabric that's nice for warmer weather.
0,There is simply a ton of fabric on this tee. i am a size 8 on top  with a fairly thin upper body but still an 8. at retailer i often order small for swingy tees  medium for more slim-cut. this tee in the small was huge. the shoulders fit well  but the body was so big and was a weirdly long length. just odd  especially for $78...
0,Super cute well made dress. runs very small. order at least two times your typical size.
0,I received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly. i?m not crazy in love with it but i also don?t dislike. the shirt is on the thin side. do i need to wear a cami underneath it  no. my concern is holes. it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes. with that being said i?ll wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing. the length is fine and i do like the slits in front?it adds a little dim
1,I just purchased this top in the store. it is definitely not tunic length as shown here  but rather hip length. also it runs a little small in the bust and had to go up a size. but it is adorable.
-1,I wanted to love this blouse so much. but try as i might  it just fit so oddly on me. i'm usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown. first. the color was more gray-brown but it was still ok. but second  the fit was off. maybe i just got a bad one  but the center of the blouse was so offset  that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the v-neck was so low that you could see my bra - there was no adjusting i could do to fix it. the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an
-1,This dress hangs like a sack. it really needs a belt to give it some shape. i tried to style it with one  but then didn't look right either. i did like the slip that came with it. i'll be returning it.
-1,This is quite an odd dress. it does wrap and is beautiful material. however  the dress does not close at all in the chest area. i thought perhaps it was meant to be a kimono. it will go back for sure.
1,"These jeans are an even dark color that can be dressed up. the material is soft and they fit perfect. they are mid rise which is a little different for me as i mostly where low rise. the only problem is that they are really long. i am 5'9"" and they are too long for me which never happens. so i need to get them hemmed and wont be wearing them for a few more weeks. i look forward to rocking them with a pair of booties or heels."
-1,If you like to wear lampshades this is the shirt for you. beyond unflattering. boxy and seriously looks like lace was stitched to the bottom of a lampshade
1,I love this jacket - can dress it up or dress it down. over a dress  skirt or jeans. very soft and flattering!
1,Easy breezy top that goes with so many outfits. i am petite (5'0''  115lb)  but like the longer look of a top  so went with 4r  thought that the arm holes would be too small if went with 2r. there is a lot of excess material around the sides...and back. i was tempted to return  but the armhole issue prevented me and it was so cute  i kept it. i think it will go through the a few seasons (seattle is unpredictable weather-wise...) and can be easily layered. i like the blouse...but don't love.
1,I absolutely love the color  cut and style of this maxi. the high neck and drop waist are both so flattering! the color and design is gorgeous as you'd expect from rana gill. i got my normal size 8 and it was perfect. i would have expected the fabric to be a little heavier but it works as a late summer early fall dress
0,This dress is beautiful but the bottom half was too tight for my shape.
0,Let me start by saying that i cannot wear wool. it doesn't matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere  it makes me itch so much that i just can't do it and i didn't not find this as itchy as others stated. that being said  you definitely need to size down. i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric. i still don't know what to think. i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point.
