-1,They ripped on the inside upper thighs of both legs less than two months after purchase. i've washed them once  and wear them a few times a week  so they're certainly not worn out. i've never had a pair give out even close to this early. i loved the cut of the jeans and the softness  and they hold their shape well after multiple wearings. the color is lighter than pictured. i paid full price (the most i've ever paid for jeans) because i'd heard good things about jean shop quality. even at sale p
1,I want to wear this skirt every day - it's so much fun to wear and versatile and i just feel great wearing it! can dress it up or down - it's pretty darn fabulous! i highly recommend it - you'll be grateful and feel pretty!
1,I had been looking for a green jacket with a hood just like this one and was thrilled to find it. i found the fit to be true to size. i am 5'4  107 pounds and i bought the xs  which is my usual size in retailer jackets. i love the material and the way it hangs so casually.
1,"I saw this online but it never struck me as something i would wear. however  after seeing it in the store it really caught my eye with its detailing  so i tried it on. what a great decision because it is so much more beautiful in person  and very soft and warm. it's a perfect winter sweater to start the new year. i am 5'-7""  138 lbs. and the medium fit perfectly  though it's a little shorter on me than shown in the photos."
0,I loved this shirt online and ordered it in blue immediately even though i usually hesitate to spend over $100 on casual blouses. unfortunately  i was super disappointed when it arrived. the lace does not contrast as much as shown in these pictures and it just doesn't look all that special. having said that  it is super comfy and soft and the sizing is generous - it may run big on you if you have a small chest. all in all  i would buy it on sale but certainly not worth the price tag!
0,I was disappointed with this jumpsuit. when i first saw it in the store  i thought i was going to love it. when i tried it on  the first issue is the fabric is too sheer. i could completely see the outline of my underwear and bra. it also runs way too big! i know the bottom is supposed to be loose and flowy  but the waist needs to be more tapered to off set that  and it's so baggy. the arm holes are also cut very low  so when you lift your arms you can see most of your bra on the sides   i wante
0,I looked forward to this dress.  it's a lovely design.  it's a heavy material that doesn't have the most flattering fit.  the green lace has snags along the hemlines which is a disappointment.  i'm returning the dress.
0,An odd top.  for my curvy figure (34g)  the seam did not enhance  but rather made me look wider.  the material is...interesting. foam-like is all i can think to describe it. the fabric and design are not as elegant looking in person.
1,Like other reviewers  i'm glad i sized down. this is a cute tunic that is definitely great quality  lightweight chambray. i love that it has pockets  but they do puff a bit at my hips.
-1,"I wanted to love this jumpsuit. it looks adorable in the product photo. i am 5'5"" about 120lbs and thus was overwhelming on me. i tried everything--- pulling up the tie at the waist to create a higher line  wearing a variety of heel heights----i couldn't seem to make it work. there was just so much fabric on me! it felt like i was wearing pajamas (and not in a cute 'wear your pajamas out' way). i love the idea and the photo appears to have an adorable line and cut. on me  this jumpsuit was just"
0,It breaks my heart to say this but i had to return for shape issues. i am not a fan of dolman sleeves (they make me look big and bulky) and i wished i would have known that prior to purchasing. it is unfortunate because it is a really beautiful knit and quality. i could see this working better on someone tall and thin.
-1,I was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover-up. the waist does not have elastic or any structure. the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed  and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open. the fabric is nice quality but i am returning.
-1,A beautiful sweater and very flattering on.  the stock photos do not do it justice.  but  i had to give it only 2 stars because it was so itchy that i couldn't even keep it on in the dressing room for more than a minute.
1,Love this dress. fits true to size!! can be dressed up or down. very flattering1 prettier in person
-1,I loved the look of this dress online so i went to retailer to try it on. in the dressing room area we were all laughing because (i tried on a small) when i got it tied to the point where it looked like the model online i couldn't raise my arms. the distance between the cuff and the waist is inches! even if you manage to lift your arms the whole dress will go with it and expose you as much as if you weren't wearing a dress at all but a shirt. too bad. poor design for sure  and such a shame when th
0,I love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist. i am normally a 8/10 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable. the quality is ok  something i feel i would see at another type of discount store. for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus.
0,I love  love  love this absolutely stunning dress. the only problem was that the zipper was very difficult to maneuver  and when it finally went up  the watch it was attached the lining of the dress made a bump in the dress  which was very unflattering on an otherwise very flattering dress. i tried on multiple versions of this dress and had the same design issue with each. i ended up returning it because it bothered me so much.
1,I was not impressed upon first taking it out of the package  it was a wrinkled mess lighter weight than i imagined and i felt like it hung like a potato sack. however after i gave it a good ironing and used the inside back tie to sinch in the waist i was in love. it draped beautiful  the blue has beautiful embroidered detail and i love the full length sleeves that can be rolled. i feel iike i will use for many seasons.
0,I ordered the yellow color way expecting it to be a mustard color. it seemed to have a greenish tint to it and didn't look right on me. also the pockets didn't lay right so the flower didn't look right.
-1,Fits like a maternity top. not for my age group or build.
-1,I was so excited to get these. i paid for two day shipping and ordered medium and large . sadly they did not fit. i usually wear medium but ordered both just in case. i'm very disappointed that they run so small and are not true to size. they are super cute from someone skinny.
1,This is such a comfy top  and the fabric is really great. more supple / flowy than i expected. it does run larger than i expected. i typically wear a large  and it's almost more billowy than i would normally prefer. i would love to try a medium to see the difference  but since it was purchased online  i'm just going with it. this will get lots of wear this season.
0,The colors on this sweater are cute  the fabric is good quality and not too thick for spring. the fit is tts.
0,Very attractive pattern and color. the black is so soft that it seems close to sepia. the length was fine. the fabric  meaning the dress  is quite heavy for not having a lining except just around the bra area---even though the facing didn't successfully substitute for a bra in my opinion. the arm holes are cut in quite a bit so one would have to find the appropriate bra.  the dress runs very large. i ordered an xs petite. it was about 2 inches too large (4 inches total) on either side across the
1,First off  the moment i put on  i got tons of compliments from complete strangers. it truly is a unique and pretty. i am 5'3 and originally wanted the med petite for length. they were sold out so i got the xs in the regular size. that worked out good. it is a bit snug around the shoulders but not enough to go up a size. overall  xs was a good alternative to medium petite.
1,Perfect shirt for a low-key day at the office. bought in the umbrella/rain (white) print. maeve blouses tend to run a little big on me but that's what i love about them. material is nice  recommend hand wash!
1,This is a great little top. the tie sits right at the waist and loose enough to slide over top of pants or shorts. the detailing at neck and shoulders is very eye catching. i received several compliments when i wore it.
0,"I ordered this in a medium and although the details/design of the shirt were cute  the ""swing"" did not work for me this time around. i typically like looser fitting tops  but with this shirt i felt like there was just too much material and made me feel like i was wearing a tent."
0,I've never owned sweater leggings before so these were my first. i had to order large because well i have some junk in the trunk (am 10/12 on bottom and 8 on top). these are a teeny bit scratchy but i'm hoping with a wash they'll soften up--but they're really loose too so i'm also hoping they'll shrink a teensy bit.
-1,"Runs extremely large. i got an xs and am 5'4"" 115lbs and this would have fit someone who typically wears a size 10-14 and is 5'6"" and above. very disappointed with the size. the quality of the fabric wasn't great either. i wanted it to work so bad but just didn't!"
0,Pretty top online - okay in person. runs small  especially on bottom hemline. thought it would have a swing to it. it does not. more sheer in person than i thought it would be. that wouldn't stop me from keeping it though. it was the way it laid on my chest that was unflattering. looked like i was wearing a bib. i don't have a large chest  just weird look on me. unfortunate  because it is an adorable print. top made for thinner or a petite lady.
0,I love a cropped pant but these do not hit the mark. the pant would have been more flattering if they hit just above the ankle instead of the calf. i think they make the leg look stunted. the material was a nice weight and good quality but the bow being attached was a big design flaw. it look cute tied but would have been much nicer if you could remove it when needed.
0,I wore this coat one day and the buttons started falling off. it stretched so much. i'm going to beg my local store to take back. it shouldn't fall apart like that. it's super duper cozy though.
-1,Do not waste your money on this.  at first  i bought pilcro hyphen chinos short and i loved it. so i bought this pants in store too. i laundry them yesterday and they both came out colorless. i was so shock.   fyi  i did not use bleach or chrolox  i mean i don''t use them.i will return them both.  still mad. this is bad quality enough worth it.
0,I was really excited to receive this caftan  but it looked very strange on my body. i have small shoulders and the xs was still very big on me. there's also a seam along the sides that made me look boxy. the quality is really great  but i thought that the color seemed a tad bit darker/muted than pictured.
1,This product i better than the pic. nice fit and a nice throw on with boots nap glad i took a chance one it
-1,I hate to be so negative but i can't believe this shirt has so many positive reviews. it is stiff  silver lace and hangs funny if you have a chest. adding a cami undnerneath makes it worse. looks cheap.
-1,1. i like a shorter jacket  but this one was poorly made and poorly fit.  2. the sleeves were way too tight. i'm a size 10 or 12  and the large which would be a 14 had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms  and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out.  3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14)   and neither hung right. the m too tight  and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.  4. very polyester with lots of static.  5. cute idea  but not very good in pe
1,"Great fun pattern. sexy styling. the other reviewers commented on how the trim is white and the body is ivory- i actually liked that. i am 5'4"" and 120 lbs. i usually wear a 4 and ordered a medium in this suit. bottom was super small and is sold out in large so i had to return it"
1,So  i really like the plaid designs by siyu. i saw these pants and questioned whether they would be tight and scratchy and ill fitting  but they were so cute  i had to find out. i'm really glad i did. the wool is soft and actually a little stretchy. it has an elastic waist  which is a plus  because sometimes  even if the legs fit  the waist is too small  or vice versa. i am a large  and very curvy on the bottom  and these are perfect and flattering  and the elastic waist is just right. as on the
-1,I tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful. i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo  i wore it one time and received so many compliments. when i washed it  however  it shrunk almost 1 size! the pant legs were high water. i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it wouldn't budge  i think because rayon is not stretchable material. to my disappointment  i returned it. i really wished it would have worked out.
0,The white is completely sheer. i am so tired of see through shirts!! even at the sale on top of sale prices  i wouldn't recommend this shirt. if the fabric weren't sheer it would be a very comfy shirt with a cute back. but it just looks silly with a tank top under it  the cotton just doesn't lay right.
1,This is a gorgeous flowy top. i paired it with a pair of army green pants and have received a ton of compliments. you can dress this top up for a night out or for work  or style it for a fun evening out. you will be very pleased with this top.
-1,I got this shirt in a medium  my normal retailer size and while the short fit  the front is cropped! i am a fan of the tops that are shorter in the front and longer in the back  however this was just too short in the front. my belly button was exposed  and that wasn't the look displayed on the model. unfortunately this top is going back to the store.
-1,I love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great. this dress does not meet those standards. on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke. i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress  i'm dissapointed.
-1,"The skirt is comfortable and as pictured. it also ran tts. i'm 5'5"" tall and weigh 140 lbs. i had the medium and didn't need to size up to a large. when you put the skirt on a normal body  it looks like you are wearing an easter egg... and not in a good way."
-1,After reading all the reviews and sizing down one size. i got my top size m  i usually wear m/l depending on the style. i'm 6 ft tall  160 lb  i like my clothing loose but not as loose as this top. i should have gone to xxxxxs if such exists. no wonder there is such a low leap in price. it is a good quality though  and very nice pale peach color. no would not recommend  unless you wear 3xxxl
-1,Ordered a size medium as i usually take a medium in retailer coats- the wool is wonderful however the stripped bands are sewn into the fabric which add to the weight. the coat has an odd shape - not a line or straight. the medium was large on me. the bottom edges of the coat did not line up when buttoned and there was no inside hook or button to help even out the bottom edges. sadly this coat will be returned.
0,The shirt is nice  but not as nice a material as i was hoping  but i kept it anyway. but after washing it  it is even more disappointing  not very soft and now kind of an odd length. hopefully it will grow on me  but wouldn't recommend it especially for the price.
0,There comes a point where i have to draw the line with things i purchase... i ordered this as i didn't have a black skirt  but thought ti wasn't special enough  don't get me wrong  it fits nicely  and is comfortable  but i was wowed. 0p or xs p fir perfectly  26.5 in waist and 115 lbs. if you want ta nice casual skirt  the sale price is a good fir for the skirt  just wasn't enough for me :-)
-1,"The review above titled ""so disappointed"" couldn't have said it any better. the dresses from last year are perfect. i probably wear them at least once a week. i was so excited to see this vibrant blue color and fully expected the same quality as last year. i'm generally an xs or s in dresses (however i have xxs from last year's version)  and the xs in this one is lifeless. it's heavy  hot  doesn't have the same nice shape as last year. i may cut out the integrated lining just to lighten the dres"
1,Love  love  love this top. it is everything i hoped it would be. i liked that it could be worn up or off the shoulder. what made me fall in love were the colors. quality is excellent as usual. it is quite full in bodice  however it's only an xs. i do best with xxs tops.
1,Love these jeans. wish i could snag another pair because the fit is just on point  as is the wash. the side slit at the ankle really looks great with heels. a definite buy.
-1,There was nothing i liked about this coat. it was definitely not designed with a chest in mind. the pins on the straps were already coming off the first time i tried it on. i usually like oranges too  but even this color turned me off.
1,Great purchase. true to size. so flattering. love it simplicity.. buy it if you enjoy compliments!
-1,This dress makes me so sad...the textured stretchy fabric  color  length  and overall swingy fit are spot on. as another reviewer noted though  the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress. the neck is tiny  which i could have gotten over once it was on  but the arm holes were just awful - too big all around (too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut). basically  you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes. it could have been so good  but alas  but t
1,These pants are perfect for any casual occasion. they can be worn to run errands  hang around the house  or even go out with friends. i love how versatile they are and they are so roomy for those times when you don't want to wear jeans or anything tight. they are a bit pricy  but i'm very happy with how they fit.
-1,I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.
0,This dress looks cute in the picture and i was hopeful since it was actually silk. i'm tired of paying close to $200 for dresses that are polyester or viscose. that being said  this dress simply had too much going on. the fabrics aren't only mixed  but there is also a faint underlying pattern on the fabric that is the same shade of the main color of fabric. it was simply too much and the black lace trim made it look kind of cheap. my real issue is that although the dress itself ran big  the uppe
1,"Love the color  fit and feel of these jeans.  the thin material is stretchy and comfortable. i didn't have to pull them up every so often during a 3 hour party.  they didn't bag out after the first wearing and are true to size.  i got a 27p (5'2""  115#).  the leg length is perfect and ends at the ankle.  the rise wasn't too low for me.  highly recommend!"
0,This dress isn't as fitted as it looks on the model. it appear to be more of a shift dress. as gorgeous as the print and quality are  it doesn't look great on me. for reference  i'm 5'5 105lbs and bought xs. for whatever reason  the high neckline isn't flattering on me. i do personally think this dress is perfect if you have broad shoulders.
1,Nice tee  true red 3/4 sleeves  lacing is a nice touch. good quality and great sale price.
-1,"I had high hopes for this top but sadly it was not meant to be. it was tts (i'm 5""3 and usually wear a small). but the material was horribly scratchy. both the body of the top as well as the sleeves. and the design isn't all that flattering. it made me look really wide at the bottom and i definitely am not in real life!"
-1,I so wanted to love the striped peplum top  however i have a petite frame with a large chest and there was absolutely no support in the top. not flattering in the least for a d-dd cup. will be returning. i imagine this would be perfect for someone with a frame like mary kate or ashley olsen :)
-1,"I'm 5' 5""  150 lbs  32dd  normally a 28p or 29p in pants. i ordered an 8 and probably should have gone with a 10. it was super unflattering?the print was overwhelming for my pale skin  it made my thin waist look larger than it really was  and rode up the inside of my thighs. i have a similar bathing suit from modcloth that's 1/3 of the price and 20x as flattering. if you have thick legs  this may not be the suit for you. i returned it--so fast."
0,It is a proper fitting oversized shirt. however  it is very flimsy and even see-through as a summer weight shirt. i returned it because i don't want to wear a tank or cami under it during hot weather.
1,I love this shirt so much i came back and bought it in black (i originally got the lavender color). it is super easy to wear and has a delicate quality to it (though i washed it on a regular cycle and it's holding up well!). as you can see from the photos  because of the wrap style  the middle of the front is shorter than the rest of the shirt. i've worn this top with regular rise jeans and haven't had a problem  though if you lift your arms  your belly may show. i purchased my usual size small
1,I love everything about this top! the fabric  the color  the fit! great top for spring and summer!
1,Due to the prior review  this top came without any surprises.  i had read about the open sleeves and actually have a dress with a similar design.  this top can be dressed up or down and is perfect with skinny pants.
0,The fit is really flattering and cute but the fabric and finishings seem really cheap. it's a printed plaid - not woven.
1,Beautiful dress! i usually wear a size 4 regular  or a 6 petite (if the dress has sleeves). i ordered this in the 6p and it is too big. wish i could exchange it for a 4p  but it's no longer available.
0,This jacket looks great and is well made. the material is very lush however the body of the jacket runs big while the sleeves are tight.
