1,I think the model photo doesn't do this dress justice. it's comfortable and perfect for a summery day. i wear it to work with a light grey cardigan  and of course it works well causally. i'm busty --d on a small frame -- but there's not gapping. the colors are pretty with blues and pinks without being childish.
0,"My firned tried this on and her first comment was ""take it off  it is scratchy""  so i didn't bother trying it on. it is  however  beautiful  if you are not sensitive to scratchy material. fit was true to size."
1,Love the way these pants look in the pictures  great quality  but the style isn't really me. i gave it a try  so that's what counts!
-1,"Nice fabric  great color  would be lovely ... on someone with a straight-and-narrow body type. for ladies with curves  take a pass--too much like maternity wear  and not in that elegantly slouchy kind of way. the straight-up ""is she or isn't she"" kind of way."
0,"Cloth and stone has been getting a little shotty lately in terms of quality. they used to be a pretty consistently high-quality brand  but lately i've been left a little bummed. i got this in ""yellow"" which is really a muddy orangey color. i think i would have gotten over the less desirable color if the fabric were better  but it is actually two very thin layers of fabric that are stacked and snag easily (sort of like a soft cheesecloth). the shirt is definitely comfortable and cute  but the qua"
0,Lovely style. i got the navy color and it's beautiful. i'm glad i ordered a smaller size after reading other reviews. my usual size would have been too big and not as figure flattering. but but but the sweater came pilled all over. i don't know if it had been worn and returned or if it's just the quality of the material but seriously there was pilling on the entire sweater. because the style is so nice and it fits well  i'm going to keep it and de-pill it but was disappointed with retailer :(
0,I'm keeping these shorts because they are cute. i sized down as the previous reviews suggested and they fit great  but they are snug around the legs. i think i would have preferred a more baggy look  but then they would have been too big around the waist (had i ordered my typical size). they are soft and comfortable  the navy color is really pretty.
-1,While i thought it looked really pretty on the hanger  when i tried it on it just felt like a mess. perhaps it suits other personalities and bodies. i hated that the zipper was in the front; i personally find it tacky and gawdy. while the patterns are pretty  the material felt like some weird fabric wallpaper and i didn't see how the price was justified with how the material felt cheap to me.
0,So i haven't actually tried this and i'm sorry for the misleading star rating. i just wanted to get someone's attention on the length. the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video  the dress is about 2 inches off the floor. is it the model in the video that is extra tall? someone help me out. this looks gorgeous but since it's an online exclusive  i won't be able to try it on at the store.
0,I don't know if i was sent a petite by mistake  but this is not 39 inches long. i realize it says swing dress  but i thought if the length was accurate and the fabric heavy enough  the weight would make it flattering on me. as it was in reality--short and light-weight fabric--it poofed out in an unattractive way. too bad  as the print is lovely.
1,Perfect in every way- easy to wear-very feminine  comfy and goes with everything. only problem is color is not like picture. it is a mauve not a light pink. i still love this top and the color it camre in. brighten up with lipstick- necklace- earrings- whatever your pick. highly recommend. a winner!!!
0,Fell in love with the look of this top in the store but they didn't have it in my size (0) -- thought i'd try the 2 as the 0 was sold out online as well. alas  the fit is rather tentlike -- it did not drape as i had hoped. a beautiful and unique pattern on the right body  but on my slight frame it was not flattering. it's going back to retailer.
0,"In the photo of the dress  you might have a hard time telling that the top half of the dress is the ""lace"" part  and is a stretchy knit fabric  while the bottom half is polyester and not stretchy at all. fyi: 36c (34d)  short waist  broad shoulders/back  usually a 10/12 in a fitted top/dress the navy lace of the top  as i said  is knit. therefore it was too stretchy  and the straps actually were already too long. it was so loose  that i needed the smaller size in the top half of the dress (10)."
-1,I was not a fan of these leggings. these were very unflattering. i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out. i just didn't feel like they would hold up for even one season.
-1,"I would say the skirt runs two sizes too small. i usually wear a size medium and based on other reviews  i purchased a large. i could barely get the skirt over my hips. even if it fit in the waist  it was much too short on me and i'm 5'2"". it's a cute skirt but it is fit for a tween."
-1,I ordered a size small (usually i am ps) but wanted the extra length. usually i can get away with a regular small but not this time. such a cute style but made me look short & wide. unfortunately it's going back
0,I ordered a six 6 petite. the pant leg was still very long. and if i have it tailored it will not preserve the whole point of these pants having a flare. this is a slim fit. i have heavy thighs and this was not for me. i'm 5' 120 lbs. also the tag warns that the fabric may leave color on lighter clothing. which i don't get  because it's spandex blend. also wasn't too hip in the zipper on the back.
1,I had been on a white jeans hunt for some time. pilcro is one of my favorite brands  and i can buy online with confidence knowing they will fit. if petite had been available  that would have been better in length  but it was not so i had them hemmed.
0,I wanted this dress to work so badly but if you have any chest or any hips this won't work for you. i tried in petites and regular and it just didn't work at all
0,This is a great feminine top i just wish it were a little bit longer for my taste  it hit about two inches below my belly button. it was a little snug around the belly area so that's why i feel it runs small for the brand  usually the brand runs true to size but not for this top
0,I really liked this cardigan when i saw it today. the cut and detail in the back is slimming and very flattering. i love the idea of the safety pin closure  and i really like how the model wears it in this photo-open with the pin on the side. when i saw this in-store  it was closed in the front with the pin  which i also like. i thought for sure the cardigan was also pinned in back when i saw it in the model  so it looked fantastic. however  when i tried it on myself  it wasn't quite the same.
-1,I ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small  especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i've purchased. very tight throughout the blouse. the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived. the material was extremely cheap in quality. it wrinkled terribly. the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet. the idea of this was perfect for my style. unfortunately  the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me.
1,I love this top. the design is flattering and the fabric drapes nicely. the length is perfect and can dress it up and down.
-1,"The image does not show but the front of the dress has a heavy 24"" utility zipper hidden with 5 snaps. the zipper pull  when closed  sat right on my collarbone  which was he height of discomfort. it felt heavy and awkward. the dress was very high waisted for me (i'm 5'6"" and it was 3"" inches above the navel)) also to the point of discomfort.  an invisible side zipper would have made the difference for me if the proportions were better suited for a non-petite sizing.  the fabric is quite beautifu"
0,"This is a pretty adorable jumper. the size 8 would fit someone really well who's about a typical size 6 and maybe 5'6"". i'm 5'9"" and it was too short. it's fun and definitely different. i'd otherwise wear it."
0,"I am 5' 7"" with an athletic build (small chest  small waist  muscular hips/thighs). this shirt just hangs on me and makes me look much larger than i am. i purchased a small  an extra small would be way too short. i could see how it works for fuller figured girls."
-1,Was very disappointed with this dress. it's very baggy  no shape. felt like an oversized sack. purchased in med. bust area was only semi good fit all else flopped :(
-1,I ordered this top in size xl. there is a lot of excess material below the empire waist so it flows out too much. this accentuated my pear-shape and was unflattering. the sizing on the top portion & sleeves was true-to-size.     the material is so rough  scratchy & uncomfortable. they should have used a softer fabric. the pattern alignment is terrible on the one i received. at $100  i hoped the plaid would have flowed in a continuous  matching line. i didn't notice the mismatched sleeves of the
1,I saw this t on sale and ordered it. i had second thoughts  thinking it would be just like a lot of ts i already have. well  i got it today and am thrilled. the fabric is so soft  a sumptuous softness that makes me feel good. the fit is the fit we all want in a great t  nice fit  not too baggy  not too tight  and it is so flattering. it doesn't show off my tummy as so many other ts do. i can wear this with jeans or a skirt. so glad i got it!
1,"This tunic dress is an easy ""go to"" outfit. it looks put together immediately. it is soft and comfortable. i ordered the regular xs even though typically i prefer petite sizing. this dress is above my knees in the front. i am 5'4"" and weight about 118#. i would have ordered a petite size but had previously tried this on in the store and knew the regular sizing was a good fit for me. in the store i tried the taupe color which seemed a bit see through. i ordered the green and it is a lovely shade."
1,Love these pilcro jeans  my usual size fit nice like skinny jeans. i know if i had gone down a size they would look too tight in the legs  they are not supposed to be leggings. they did not stretch out too much all day - slightly in the waist  not enough to size down. the dark color is perfect for winter! they are very comfortable!! love pilcro jeans!
1,These pants are perfect for crisp fall weather and comfortable! i wear them with flats to dress down or heels to dress up! recommended for all shapes!
0,I really liked this top when i saw it online. i went to the store to check the sizes. i am a small or a medium. i tried on the s and the xs. even the xs was huge. unfortunately the xxs is sold out. i don't understand the sizing on this at all. it's a shame because the top itself is very pretty. just be sure you try it on before purchasing.
0,"At 5'5"" (almost)  122lbs.  i always wear a size small. however this dress runs large (no  i am not smaller than i was 6 months ago) and it looked like a dumpy sack on me. too bad  i really wanted it to fit! it is a slightly heavier fabric than anticipated  and would be an excellent travel dress. i may try the xs. . ."
-1,I purchased these pants on 12/2/15 as a more fashionable alternative to yoga pants while traveling southeast asia starting february. after about 10-15 wears (with little washing in between as i was backpacker style traveling) the pants wore through in between my legs. the fabric first started to develop little fuzz balls everywhere and then literally disintegrated in places. i tried to sew them to continue wearing them while traveling but alas the fabric had become so thin that the thread could
-1,I loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets. however  the material was quite thin and the quality was not great- there were multiple snags along the seams. additionally  at 5'8  130lbs i was swimming in the size 4. i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better.
-1,"I ordered the white ""denim"" online and was very disappointed by how thin the material was. i had tried on the light blue denim in the store and it had a nice weight to it. the style is wonderful and the fit is very flattering  but too sheer for me to wear outside the house!"
-1,This skirt looks and feels cheap  and the color is much more green than pictured. additionally  i comfortably wore a size 4 and then lost a few pounds  and this is still way too tight to be flattering.
1,Gave this sweater to my mom this christmas and she has hardly taken it off...so cozy and cute!
-1,This dress didn't work for me at all. i'm 6ft tall  160lb  i usually wear size l 8/10  but based on the reviews i ordered an m. the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy  color is about the same as pictured  also length is appropriate. dress is very thick and warm  the fabric however has no stretch at all  dress is very specious and shapeless. there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders & sleeves  i thought that area was tight & snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe
1,"I like the top without the fake fur collar. when the collar is removed the neckline's shape is really nice. the collar seems cheap. i thought the sweater ran true to size. i'm 5'7"" 115 lbs. a small was a good fit although higher armholes would have made the whole thing fit better through the rib cage. it was loose there  but necessary looseness for layering anything underneath."
-1,This dress is a potato sack! from the picture i thought it was going to be a cute drop waist dress but the tailoring is so weird!! and it's huge on me  so maybe it would be better if i sized down but again based on the tailoring i think not. also the fabric is strange  not at all what i expected. i'm so sad :( i was really excited about this dress.
-1,Maybe i shouldn't have sized up to an xl but i'm not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit. the vee is quite low and i'm busty. it'll be really low if you're smaller on top. the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me. not tight at all. it's almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view  i looked like a really wide green apple. i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i wouldn't recommend it.
1,"Love this dress so much! i bought the cranberry color first  and i loved it so much  that i also bought it in black. i think it runs fairly true to size. i am 5'3"" and about 110  and the xs petite fit perfectly. i tried the xs  and it was pretty large on my frame. i love the fabric and flow of this dress  and i love the pockets."
-1,This dress is so cute! i went to the store to try it on and although i knew the dress would fit i could not get the zipper up. my mom  the sales lady and i all tried to get the zipper up and it would not move past the ribbon. i wish i could have bought this dress but i can't without a working zipper. i tried a size up and every dress at the store that was my size and none of them worked. please fix the zipper problem so i can have this dress!
0,I agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online. the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering. i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it.
-1,I had hopes for this shirt but was disappointed in the fabric...it's very stiff and heavy for a summer blouse. will be returning it.
1,When i first put this dress on  i immediately thought...oh no  i can't pull this off. at least  not without a cow to milk. but this dress is so comfortable. the material feels divine and the quality really is excellent for the price. the pattern of the panel on the bodice creates a slimming effect so it is also very flattering if you can get the waist to hit right. (i had to try on a few different bras to make this happen.) fits true to size. i got a size 2 - my usual size and i have gained a fe
1,"The pattern ""camouflages"" my curvy figure :-) . the fabric is very soft  great for lounging. i wish the fabric offered a little more support though for working out."
-1,This blouse is stunning on the website ;however  it is totally sheer which you cannot tell from the photo. i was very disappointed and will be returning.
-1,"This top was just not flattering. i'm 5'8"" and medium build  and the m was very bulky and the fabric didn't fall in the right places. made me look very round and i'm not  so it's definitely going back!"
0,The item i received was not distressed. i bought one size larger thinking they'd be super slouchy  but they just looked sloppy. also  the hips puffed out in a very strange way. i wanted to love since they are so cute and soft  but i look like a man with hips in these jeans. returning this weekend.
1,I am so amazed that i finally found the perfect  straight legged denim! not too skinny nor too tight b/c i have athletic calves. i have been waiting a long time! for reference i took a size 26 and usually wear a 2. it is great and comfortable for someone my age! i love these and they are the best investment.
1,"I love this dress! it is beyond flattering! i tried the south shore dress on earlier this year but found it too short for my taste. this however.. is the same cut on top  but longer in the skirt! yes  please! i purchased the turquoise  which is exactly as pictured! just beautiful! hits at my shins. for reference  i'm 5'6""  136 lbs and ordered a size small."
-1,This material is a nice quality but the shirt is boxy and shapeless. it was not flattering at all on my shape. i don't think it would look nice on anyone with an hourglass shape or fuller chest.
1,Very different. i love the unique design and it is appropriate for various settings .
1,Perfect except a little snug around the hips. very forgiving silhouette.
-1,"I was so excited about this skirt and pairing it with a cute blouse for the warmer weather. as i took out the skirt out of the package and flipped it around  the back has mesh strips that are see through! there is also no lining to go with this skirt. if you go back to the ""back view"" picture on the website and zoom in closely  you can see the model's black underwear."
1,"I've been looking for white beach shorts and these are perfect! as another reviewer said  they are in fact see-through -- because they are meant to be a cover up  not ""real"" shorts. the hem detail is very cute and they're super comfortable! my size small fit tts  and the 3"" hem is nice for tall women."
1,Love  love love this top. it's got a little bit of a native american vibe without being over-the-top. i tend to wear a small in retailer  but the medium was the way to go for me. it's not long  and the style errs on the not-tight side. if you can go between two sizes  don't get the smaller one. and i love the shade of yellow!
0,Ordered navy in a medium and it is wide. sometimes that's a good thing  but not this time. am short waisted and hoped this would be more fitted at the waist on me but it isn't. it just looked frumpy with lots of see through parts. obviously it needs a cami but wasn't attractive on me at all. seemed well made and probably better on someone taller.
-1,"Maybe it's my curves or the way i'm only 5'4"" but this was a hot mess on me! it is soooo long and cut to low for my 36d chest. it is slim and the cut usually is flattering but somehow this dress was anything but! it is really shiny and the material is heavier than anticipated for warm weather. if you are super tall and skinny with no boobs  go for it! had to send back!"
0,"I love the designs of tiny blouses. but i wish they could make them more durable. i have owned several blouses in the past where i have to use a little pin to secure the button line from pulling at the breast area  or that after a few delicate washings have come apart at a seam. and ironing or steaming them is a must. this blouse was no exception. it went back because of pulling at the bust. i'm willing to take some extra care of my clothing out of my busy schedule  but i shouldn't have to! 5'7"""
0,I was looking forward to trying this on after seeing it in the catalog. i wear an xs or small in retailer tops and tried this on in an xs. it was huge. reminded me of a maternity top. it was much more flowy on me than it looks on the model. the material was nice  thin but not see through. the macrame detailing seemed well made. i'd recommend this if you're looking for a flowy top but definitely size down.
1,I love this shimmer tank-in both colors! it is a very thin fabric-thinner than i would have expected  but i think this is okay since i would use it for layering and probably never wear it as a standalone tank. i think you can never go wrong with sparkles  especially in a layering tank-it dresses up or fancies up the outfit. the straps on this tank are not adjustable  and if you are large chested  i think a lot of cleavage would show in this tank. i would have preferred the sleeves are very sligh
0,Frustrated that the details don't mention there's a side zip. for whatever reason  i have the hardest time fitting into dresses with side zips and so i was annoyed that the details say it's a pull-on style when that's not the case. there's also no give in the waist. besides the fit not working for me  it was a pretty dress but overall a little too much going on.
-1,It was quite a bit shorter on me than what it shows on the model who is the same height. the pull-on styling is a #fail as i could barely get my head through the neck opening! i was afraid it might rip a seam. the fabric seems low quality  like it would stretch out and degrade faster than others. overall  not the dress or quality i expected :/
1,"Loved it on the hanger and when i tried it on. it's a gorgeous shade of blue (denim  not navy) with some light tie-dye streaking along the top and sides which add interest. the ""bat wing"" feature is a little limiting; i won't be able to reach anything high without the whole top coming up with me. as for the material  it's an interesting blend bc it isn't soft or rough. some may say it's itchy and some may say it's soft  to me it isn't either. it's merely smooth enough. which sounds terrible  ""it"
0,This top runs large. i am a 34 d and usually a medium or small. the medium was a little loose in the bust  but incredibly loose and swingy in the waist. my figure was lost in the fabric. the small was too small for me in the bust  although the waist looked more flattering. the coral color was lovely and bright and not too sheer.
0,I ordered online and wear xs- m. i ordered a small but it seems big. i have to drive 1+ hour to a store so i do a lot of online ordering. i'm thinking of returning for smaller size. may make a road trip- have several items to return! i hate paying shipping to buy and shipping to return if it doesn't work!
1,The materical is wonderful and light and the color is gorgeous  but the large was absolute gigantic. i'm returning it and sizing down possible to a small  which is unreal  since i wear a size ten normally! i am petite  height-wise  but more than length  there was just so much room width-wise. it swallowed me! the dress itself is lovely  though  so i'm definitely exchanging for a more reasonable size. but definitely size down!
1,I love these jeans! i wear them all the time. i love the way they fit and the price is great. please make these exact pants in more colors!
