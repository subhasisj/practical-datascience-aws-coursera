1,This is so beautiful! i loved it online  but it's even prettier in person. it's a little greener than it appears in the photo. the straps are actually a green rather than white. i'm 5' 6'' 123 lbs and the xs fits perfectly. worth the money!
0,I was so excited when this dress arrived today. as other reviewers have mentioned  the fabric is lovely  soft and drapey and it feels great on. it felt great  that is  until i looked in the mirror. while the dress fit fine  i have a large bust  and the fabric stretched across the bust  causing the print to appear washed out across the bust. not a good look. sigh. another return.
1,I bought this top in a small and it was true to size. loved that it wasn't too fitted across the back  but was still able to show a bit of body with the drawstring by the waist. it will become a wardrobe staple during the hot months in dallas.
-1,I waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed. loved the skirt part of it. but the top  which i guess i didn't see in photo was pleated as well  made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides. would have been a wonderful summer dress  flowing and cool.
0,I ordered this sweater in black and thought it was a pretty design and something different in a cardigan. when i tried it on  it was an odd fit and very boxy and unflattering. i wanted to like it and keep it  but i knew i would not wear it so  unfortunately  it went back.
0,"I got the pilcro hyphen chinos in a size 25p and they fit  so i assumed i would be the same size in the pilcro stet chinos...nope. the 25p was way short and way tight. i'm 5'3"" and about 113 lbs. my mom is 5' and 98 lbs and they fit her so i gave the 25p stet chinos to her to keep. disappointed!"
0,I have more of an athletic figure  and the sleeves tend to come in closer to the body than pictured. i didn't like that cut on my arms/torso. the shirt is really cute  otherwise! i am usually a size 4/small and this was a little short and snug.
-1,This dress either runs large or just has too much fabric. ordered my usual size  but it is too long and too baggy to do a thing for me. embroidery pretty  but background is more of a muddy gray  then denim as shown. if the smaller size in petite was available  i'd have exchanged it  but it is going back.
0,My title perfectly describes my attitude toward this sweater. the print is super cute and the price point is great  but this sweater was so itchy that i couldn't even keep it on for longer than a minute. it may be okay with a long sleeve underneath  but don't even think about wearing it by itself!
0,"I ordered this skirt hoping i could wear it to work as it looked tailored on the model. this skirt is made from a heavy material but flares out. it is a whole lot of skirt! i'm 5'2"" and short waisted it looked like i was getting swallowed up.  i love the colors and design but it just overwhelmed me. it would work on someone taller."
1,"An retailer associate gave me this to try on since i love white clothing and lace. i tried on a large for my 5'9""  36c. hourglass frame and found it to be a tad large and probably could go down a size. my thoughts are.... _______________ pros: - breathable and comfortable fabric due to cotton/linen blend. - lace detailing at the top is lovely. - runs tts except i found the arms ran a tad small (and i have smaller circumference). but there's enough stretch. _______________ cons: - extremely sheer!"
0,I was really excited to see what this looked like in person. when i unpacked this shirt i was shocked to see what how short it looked. the colors are very close to what you see online but the shirt is super boxy. i have a smaller torso and it barely came to below my waist. you can't tell by the picture but this shirt can fit at least 2 people in the width. when i tried it on  it didn't look as boxy but still a really weird cut! it was disappointing because it looks so cute online! i will be retu
0,"Loved the fabric but returning because the armholes are cut waaaaay too low. unless you have 30"" arms  all you get is an unnecessary showing of your bra"
-1,"1. i'm 5'6"" tall with a short waist and long legs  and this skirt came all the way down to my ankles. i would have kept it if it had stopped mid-calf like in the photo.  2. i'm 38-32-40 and the size 12 fit me perfectly in the waist hip area  so i would say it runs true to size.  3. the buttons lay nice and flat over the tummy  so that's a plus. at least you don't have to undo them to go to the bathroom."
-1,The fabric was nothing special (i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric  but this was stiff feeling) and the pattern was cute. but what made me return it was the fact that 1) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint. literally. puffy. paint. and 2) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived. parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it. i could barely unfold it.  i'm sure this could have been cute  but who wants a top that looks lik
-1,"The quality and fabric are fabulous but it's just too voluminous for my figure (5'8""  155 lbs)  would look great on someone more slender."
0,I love the colors in this top  but i returned it for a few reasons.  the material is extremely fragile; with small kids i knew this would be snagged all over after my first day of wearing it.  my other issue was that it came to just below my belt on me.  i was under the impression from the photo that it was more of a tunic style top.  i'm 5'6 and it just didn't look that way on me.
1,I ordered this last week and received it yesterday and have to say it is a lovely dress. the fabric is light but looks quite rich  making one want to touch the textile. the dress pattern reminds me of a missoni. oh  the dress is lined. i purchased the blue pattern  and am planning on wearing it to work on friday.
0,Cute skort but seems to run big. it's also sort of long for shorts (the model must have much longer legs than me). i may try a size smaller since i love the print but i'm not optimistic.
0,I wanted to love this top so badly. between the beautiful photos and the good reviews  i didn't think i could go wrong with it. unfortunately  it just didn't look great on. the bust area sagged on my smaller chest  and then the top flared way out from the waist down. it doesn't lay even remotely flat like the photos would have you believe. maybe this would look better on hourglass or slim types. the quality does appear to be good -- the material is weighty and soft.
0,I'm just not sure about this top... it's very short. i'm short-waisted  and it could stand to be at least an inch longer in front for me. and as another reviewer pointed out  there's no closure in front. i can't imagine wearing it without a tank underneath... one good stiff breeze and everyone would get a peep show. it really seems more like a vest than a shirt. it's cute enough with a tank underneath  but that sort of defeats the purpose of an easy summer top... it's too hot for layers in the s
-1,This top really is lovely. i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans. i wash everything before i wear it. though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned  there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned. so i hand washed it with delicate soap. when the lighter colors came into contact with the black  the black immediately stained the light color. i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains  rinsed and hung it above my bath tub. it is cur
1,I a looking forward to wearing this dress with a jean or leather jacket. the dress is well made and the fringe adds a nice detail to the otherwise basic design. be sure to order a couple of sizes smaller than your regular size because the dress is huge. i ordered the dress in both colors and am keeping the blue.
-1,I saw this very shirt online & thought it was so pretty. in person  the shirt seems flimsy. the buttons look as though they'd fall off. i also didn't like the cut of the shirt. it seemed to be tighter on top & looser on the bottom. had to return. i couldn't justify the cost with the quality.
0,I purchased the blouse in both the ivory and black. the black i decided to keep because it will go with anything. i was hoping the ivory blouse would work but it's thin and see through. if someone could please tell me where i could find a casual  white or ivory blouse that is not entirely see through i would greatly appreciate it!
0,"When i received this dress today i was really excited to try it on. it is a pretty dress. looked good in the pictures. however  when i examined it and proceeded to try it on  i was really disappointed. the quality is ok  but not expected for the price paid. and the cut is off. it is extremely small at the top. i am not big by any means( 32d 109lbs  5'0""). the bottom part fit. sadly  not impressed. this one is going back :("
-1,Not flattering and not the color it appears online. this is really a pink shirt.
-1,Love the softness and the length. the color was perfect. but you have be be a very skinny almost boney person for you to not show imperfections to your body. the fabric is not thick enough and does not have the give to over shadow normal imperfections. will be returning the sweater.
1,This is a lovely blouse. it has an empire waist type cut  which camouflages tummy and hips nicely (especially after a large holiday meal!). i'm usually between a small and medium (4-6) and didn't really notice much of a different between the two sizes.  **note: it does not come with the camisole shown in the photo  but any black or white standard camisole would work.
1,"This romper is fabulous! i bought it in lime  and the color is great and perfect for summer. i do agree with the other reviewers that it's hard to get in and out of the sleeves (hence giving it only 4 starts for quality#  but the struggle is worth it. the fabric is lightweight and silky  so it feels cool and soft; it feels like wearing pjs. it's also very flattering with the bow just at the waist; it hides a not-so-flat tummy. i'm 5'4""  between 135 and 140  and curvy #very busty specifically)  a"
1,Could not wait to try this on when it arrived  jumpers are tricky in the way they can ride up and become unflattering. not the case here  i usually wear a size 8 but i decided to order a size down for a size 6. i am 5'5 and 150 lb. being the fact that i am in the midst of losing weight i thought i would rather it be more snug and this really was just right. the pockets make it casual and cute  while the print and bare shoulder make it fresh and chic. you will love!
1,"I received this tee in grey as gift and immediately went online to buy another!  beware because the color names are confusing. i originally thought it was a mix up in the naming on the website so i ordered the ""red""  thinking i'd get the red colored tee. however  the ""red"" tee is actually a light orange color. the ""orange"" tee is actually a burgundy/red color.  i ended up keeping the orange colored tee although i actually wanted the red color  because i really do love the quality of this shirt!"
0,I was excited about this dress because i love the colors and print. the dress has no shape though and not in a good way. it's not flowy enough for the look of a shape dress but its not fitted enough to be flattering.
0,Why does the lining stop at mid thigh when the skirt is long? makes product look cheap while wearing. love the color  the fabric  and the fit  but cant get past this less than quality feature - will be returning.
-1,It is a beautiful sweater  but it is cropped and boxy.
-1,I loved this shirt so much i bought it in 4 colors. however  two of them shrunk. i was very disappointed.
-1,Pilcro stet roll ups are my fave! i have about 5 or 6 pairs and i needed a replacement for my light wash so i went in the store and tried these on. wow has the quality changed. the denim is a lot lighter in material  now  the wash isn't as real  almost like i'm wearing jegging shorts. these were my favorite but now i'll have to look for light wash denim shorts elsewhere because these new ones just wont cut it anymore! why  pilcro?? the sizing is about the same  they run a little large due to the
-1,I so wanted to love this sweatshirt. it is very soft and seems like excellent quality and material. the pattern is pretty  and i envisioned spending hours cuddled up reading in it. unfortunately  the body of the sweatshirt (particularly the front torso area) was too big  and it popped out around me like a balloon. the arms fit well  so i don't think that i could have gone down a size. i was also not keen on the way the neck hung  which was either very stiff and tall around my neck when unfolded
1,Comfortable  relaxed fit. i am very top heavy and the generous cut of this dress worked well!
-1,This top is has an awkward neckline  doesn't lay like the photo (as mentioned by another reviewer.) see threw  and of poor quality. the fit is very baggy and unflattering. and material is very thin. it also runs very large!! the color is pretty  but that is it :(
1,This blouse is perfect for a summer afternoon. it;s very light and the v neck back on it is super cute. the coloring is amazing. it's hard to find anything with those two colors incorporated. looks perfect with jeans or shorts and can be dressed up or dressed down. i am a solid 12 in everything...tops and bottoms and this shirt was no differemt. i like it a little loose so i went with my normal size but i am sure i could have gone down to a 10 as well. don't pass this up. it's a lovely lovely to
-1,I thought this suit would be the perfect solution of stylish but forgiving of my new mom bod. this one didn't work for me. i ordered the medium. the top is very small--i would recommend only for b cup or smaller. the full coverage bottoms did nothing for my shape. it seemed to make me seem rounder and shorter. sending this one back! i did find success same size in a faux wrap style retailer suit.
-1,Like one of the previous reviewers  when my jacket arrived  it was not in the great dark wash pictured online. it was in a basic  medium denim wash. i like the wash pictured online; i did not like the wash the jacket came in. additionally  know that it is just huge. i ordered my usual size (medium) and understood that the jacket was meant to be roomy and swingy  but there is no way that one size down would be enough to compensate for how swimmingly large it was. i never tried an xs  but it was s
1,What can i say? this is a winner! it is stunning  gorgeous  a perfect summer dress that looks like sunshine and orange sorbet. it is classic  early 1960s look  which is exactly my style! i am usually a 14 or a 16  so i went with a 16 based on the reviews  and it fits divinely. i don't need another orange dress  but this is a keeper!
-1,This top looked positively vulgar on!!!! i am a 34d  and it was way too low cut...my boobs were spilling out!!! in addition  the fabric reminded me of a cheese cloth.....it just looked and felt cheap. unfortunately  this top will be going back.
0,This shirt is so cute in the picture but not so great in person. i bought the short sleeve version this summer and loved it! this runs really big so maybe a smaller size will help.
-1,Such a cute pattern  and i loved the fold-over design  but beware - there is not enough bottom coverage! i should've looked more closely at the photo - it's pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage. a couple more inches of fabric would've really helped. i'm used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms  and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with. i could maybe wear them around my husband  but definitely not my dad! i felt like if i bent
1,I love this skirt. i usually don't buy skirts of this cut because they make me look hippy. but the fabric is so lightweight and flowing  and yet it has structure. the colors are great and go with many top options. i wear it to work and casual outings. it is my favorite clothing article in my closet right now.
1,"This jumper is gorgeous! i usually don't instantly spend almost $300 on one piece without contemplating  but as soon as i tried this on  i fell in love. i had to order it online because i needed the xsp as the xs in store was way too big. please be warned that this runs large and definitely buy the petite if you are petite or a little taller... i am 5'3"" for reference and even at 5'3"" it's barely short enough to not be too long on me. so if you are an inch or two taller  i would recommend the pe"
-1,This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also  the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top  the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable
-1,First of all it arrived rolled in a tight ball the size of a large starbucks coffee. i don't know why they do that.... you're not going to be immediately impressed by something that is packaged like it's cheap! second  i'm usually a 0-4 in retailer and mine is no where near as loose-fitting as the photo. also  he sleeves and back are a very thin waffle knit... like a flimsy t-shirt. and see-thru. the sleeves form-fit to my arms so i couldn't layer under it  but i couldn't wear it alone with the fa
0,Sadly  i returned this one. i'm a 36d bra size and this shirt could not handle that. it fit around my chest  so sizing up was not necessary  but my chest caused the straps to shift and sit funny on my shoulders. cute top and well made for those who can fit into it better!
1,Another maeve maxi to add to my crowded closet! i adore the print  it reminds me of morocco. i went with my usual m based on reviews about the waistband. i will have to disagree as i should have chosen s instead. i'm not going to return it  but i think this will really stretch out because of the knit and weight of the jersey.
1,The fabric is very light weight  more of a shirting material.  this surprised me because the dark flowers almost looked like flocked velvet in the picture.  the flowers are actually printed on cotton that has woven stripes.  it is so soft and light!  there is also a little webbing detail in the front yoke but nothing shows because there is a simple sewn in lining.  the skirt is not lined but the hem is weighted with a trim so that the skirt will hang right.  very flattering.  it does run big tho
-1,A serious joke. i struggled with the buttons for a good 10 minutes and gave up after the 3rd button. i'm not sure what they were thinking.
1,I was hesitant to buy this top after reading previous reviews  but i love it! granted  i am two months postpartum so i am looking for tops that are airy (it's summer in socal) but cover up my tummy. the material is soft and stretchy and it does have a loose shelf bra type inset---so not a real bra but at least something there. i wore a free people bralette with it and it looked perfect! really happy with this top!
1,I tried on almost every dress in the shop today  and this is the dress. as soon as i tried it on i started twirling around. i felt beautiful and i couldn't stop smiling. my mother said that it makes my blue eyes glow. it flatters my figure by hanging perfectly across my bust-line  floating over my curves  and camouflaging my little unappealing bumps. also  the dress is cut nicely under the arms which allows coverage for a strapless bra. i chose the medium size even though i usually wear a large
-1,Ugh  i hate that this didn't work! the top shoulder/sleeve portion is so pretty and unique  but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling  the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is (the sides go way up on me). the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash. back it goes!
1,I'm a 36ddd and although that's pretty large  i don't generally have trouble fitting into most retailer clothing. (the tracy reese amoret dress  for example  fits just fine in my regular size.) so  i ordered this dress in my regular size. well  i tried it on  and the right and left sides of the front closure on top were literally about 10 inches apart. there was *no way* this would fit  even if i went up 3 sizes. it's crazy! this is a terrible shame because it's really a lovely dress and it fits j
0,Okay  so this top has its redeeming qualities  i promise! which is why i gave it 3 stars when i really wanted to give it two. but it's just not worth 2 because i'm sure it works for some people and the quality is just impeccable. for people who purchase this  it will last forever. it's sturdy cotton  not thin like many retailer tee materials. the lace detail and texture is on point and the neckline is very nice. it's a great looking top. my issue though  wasn't with the bust as other reviewers hav
-1,I'm a short girl  but i usually wear tops in a small or medium at retailer. for me  i would have needed this shirt in a size at least one notch smaller than even offered. this shirt is adorable. love the details. i wanted it so bad  which is why i paid so much for a basic t-shirt. still  it was large to the point of frumpiness and could have used some sort of scoop or v-neck to break up the dots.
0,I love the style of this dress  but unfortunately  it runs very small. i normally wear a size 8. i ordered a 10 and the dress was closer to a size 6. disappointed that i had to return it. also  the seams were poorly done and threads hung out everywhere on the hem.
0,"I loved the rich navy blue color with the accent pockets. the fabric was a nice weight  not too thin like lots of retailer tops. i liked the top from the front  however the back was way too long  especially with the looseness of the style. it would have been much better if it were not so much longer in the back and maybe a little more fitted. it might work on someone taller. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. and i tried xs."
1,This is one of those 'i need one in every color' kind of shirts. need - not simply want. it is very well constructed. the fabric is the perfect weight and is sooooooo comfortable. the raspberry is a little more dusty rose than pictured online  but it works. i've only had the shirt a couple of day. in addition to wanting to wear it every day  the fabric has not pilled. i'm short-waisted  and i have not had any issue with the high-low hem or cropped length.
0,I was so excited to get this! the fabric is beautiful - comfy soft and a great wash/print of blue. it reminded me of the ocean. however  the fit was off. the waist was too high  the length too short  and the straps to long. i was very disappointed. i considered taking it to the tailor before returning. ultimately  i decided to return.
-1,It's a beautiful lace designed tank top in a vibrant navy blue; however  the lace on the hemlines were snagged.  the top was much shorter than i had anticipated.  i'm returning it to the store  unfortunately.
1,I ordered this shirt last week  it's beautiful!!!!! it's even prettier than the photo. i'm 5.3 120lbs  i ordered the petite 6 and it fit perfectly!!!! i wish it came in more colors  i'd order another one in a minute!
0,I wanted to love this dress as it would have been perfect for a wedding i have in october however  the fit was awful;. the dress was heavy with a funky liner. it also had these little black straps around the top of the arm/neck that looked out of place. it ran true to size but i have a large chest (32dd) and it was pretty fitted around the area but loose everywhere else.     sadly  dress had to be returned.
0,I typically take a m or a l in retailer tops/sweaters  so i ordered one of each  as this has been on back-order for forever. the medium was swimming on me - and i have a very athletic frame  with huge traps and biceps. i could have easily taken this in a small and still had plenty of length in the sleeves - and i have very long arms.   ---------  this sweater is thick and heavy. there's no way here in atlanta it can be worn anytime other than spring and the occasional very  very cool summer night.
1,This bikini is so gorgeous and fit me like a glove. i'm a true xs  bra size 34a. i ordered the small. this was more than worth full price!
1,This is a throw it on and you're cute.  so easy and comfy  requires barely any styling to look cute in this.  and it has pockets!
