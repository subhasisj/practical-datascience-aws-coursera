1,"These are the best trousers i have bought in a long time! i'm 5'8 and 145 pounds and the 8 fit with a bit of extra room in the waist--not enough to size down. i love that they are not ""skinny""--so over the skinny fit. i plan to wear these with black heels  white tee  and the vegan black leather jacket i purchased at the same time--oh  and a statement necklace--always a statement necklace. these are a must for every fall wardrobe! more pants like these  please!"
1,I love the fabric  texture mix and length of this top. i gave it a four stars because my usual size is a medium but had to go with a large. a medium felt a bit too snug through the shoulders. very happy with this top and look forward to wearing it a lot.
1,This will be a great summer staple.  good fit and very comfortable.  may go back and buy another color
-1,Ugh  the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but  the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok  if not a tad big  but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn't even zip it without a ton of effort. i don't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing.
-1,While the print is cute  the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller. the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model (it rides up under your boobs) and the whole cup area tips forward - it's not really molded like a bra  more flat foam insert. immediately went back. hopefully  if retailer continues to do swimwear  they'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they're also workable for fuller cup sizes (underwire please!)
-1,This is the worst shirt i have ever tried on from retailer. it is basically a big shaggy box from the front  and from the side it looks like a tent. it is also short.
1,Beautiful and very versatile dress. extremely forgiving for post baby bodies  while stylish and classy.
0,I can't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted (if so  it's too big but the length works)  or if it's supposed to sit on my hips (fits well but too long). but the material is really comfortable  and the design is different in a good way.
1,I usually wear an xs and in this i wore a small because on the bottom of the sleeve  it was tight. it's a great piece and i get a lot of compliments.
0,Loved the idea of this but content felt too thin and sheer.
1,I'm sad i was unable to get an xs  as the small is somewhat big on my 125-lb 5'6 frame. i'm keeping it for the sale price though! when i put it on in the store i got so many compliments from other customers who went to find it! i think it is meant to run large  and honestly i still think even with it looking big it still looked better in person than the model. i would recommend ordering it if you can and don't mind pieces that drape like this!
1,This dress is so comfortable and so sexy. hugs your curves. probably would not look great on an athletic frame. i bought on sale and was a good price. i usually wear a 2 or 4 in retailer  and the xs fit fine. the small was much too baggy.
0,They were ok pants but too small. the texture and shape were not what i expected either.
1,Cute sweater! the side panels are perforated so you may want to wear either a nude bra or a cami underneath..
0,"The dress at first glance is pretty  feminine  and a timeless shape. sadly the quality just isn't there.  i ordered online and was excited trying it on (dress fit true to size for me  all be it a little snug in the chest).  the zipper is super cheap  hard to get up or down on or off the hanger.  the appliquã©s are sewn onto a super flimsy netting  already coming detached without even having worn it.  i could see this dress catching on ""everything"" and tearing easily.  given the quality i'm return"
-1,Got this in purple and love it! ordered red and silver and only received red so far  but had to return because it was oddly shaped and didn't fit well like the purple. not sure what happens. maybe miss sized?
-1,I tried this blouse on and loved the style  comfort and color of the peach so much that i was preparing to buy it. when i pulled the sleeve the fabric came away from the cuff. i tested another spot pulling only gently and the same thing happened. too bad since the color would have been a great addition for me.     but--i also tried the blue and it gets 4 stars  as the fabric is much better. it too is adorable  soft and did not tear on gentle testing. the two blouse colors are made from different
-1,I have blazers in size 8 from this designer and they fit with room to spare. i understand this is a more fitted style  but it is still way too small. size 10 and size 12 were not much bigger. great colors and cute design  but just too small even if you do not plan on buttoning it. i hope they bring back this jacket but make it true to size.
-1,Love this dress! wore it last night for a musical event... came home and put it on the hand wash setting in the washer with cold water...just as the label states. pulled the dress out and guess what? the design is completely faded!!! it looks 5 years old :( so sad. i'm going to call retailer and ask for a refund (i live two hours away)
-1,According to the label  this dress can be hand washed or dry cleaned. i hand washed and line dried per the instructions on the label  and all the seams have completely shrunk and gathered. it looks like there's a drawstring running through every seam. so disappointed in the quality and the labeling. awful! i gave it one extra star because it's cute.
1,The delicate print and coloring are stunning. i also like the length and fit and am really enjoying this dress.   the key hole opening was a little low and showed my bra so i had to sew up the bottom inch  i also agree with an earlier comment that a full lining would be nice.    this is the first dress i have bought from retailer because i generally find dresses are too short and do not provide enough coverage at the top. i hope that future collections will include midi dresses and hemlines
-1,I purchased this top in blue and liked it so i ordered the red color. i hated the way the second one fit. i'm concerned the blue will not wear well after seeing the way the second one looked!
-1,I love this tank  it is so comfortable but it does have its flaws. it rolls up every time i walk or do anything  it becomes very bothersome.
1,"When i tried on this dress my husband's jaw dropped to the ground. it is so unique and so beautiful on. however the cut of the fabric fit oddly on me so i am exchanging for a small with fingers crossed. i am a size 6  5'8"" and the medium just felt a little boxy over the middle section. my six year old son said that it was the most beautiful dress he had ever seen. buy this!"
0,I made a visit to the store specifically to try on this dress and it was a disappointment for me. i tried on size 6 regular (i'm 34b  26 waist  36 hips) and i could not zip the dress up half way. the zipper is on the side  but it's more to the back which i have to stretch my arms all the way back to reach it. it stopped at my waist and was too tight for me to zip up anymore. i tried on an 8 regular and the entire dress was huge. (i'm 34b  26 waist  36 hips). i like the regular size because the l
0,I expected better from this top  it is thin  will snack easy  and you have to wear a cami underneath. for the price  not worth it. definitely returned!
-1,"This is a very awkward and unflattering shirt. i am very petite--90 pounds and 5'2"". the arms fit--length and width  but nothing else about this fit. the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath. it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs. yikes! it looks cute on the model  but not on me. the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top."
-1,Nice design but very wrinkly fabric that doesn't fall well. also  as has happened to me before  retailer sent me a dress clearly worn/used and returned by someone else with hair all over it. you would think they would at least look at returned dresses to make sure that the returned clothes were free of stains and hair before they send them out.
-1,What is going on with maeve sizing this season? in the past two months  i've purchased two maeve dresses that run very small--particularly at the waist.  having many maeve items from past seasons and other recent retailer purchases  it's impossible to ignore that maeve's sizing is quite off. that aside  the vibrant summer colors and material quality are great. the skirt is lined but billowy and fuller than ideal. strangely  it's a lot of dress yet not enough at the same time. there bodice h
1,"I read the rave reviews  but tried this on with low expectations. i am curvier on top so i thought the dress would make my chest look huge and show my tummy budges. the dress was the exact opposite - so flattering and a piece i could truly dress up or down. i am 5'6""  135lbs and a small fit perfectly. i rarely purchase anything at full price but plan to circle back to my local retailer to pick this up today."
0,So small! i was a solid size 12 in skirts but recently lost some weight. i was still nervous to buy a size 10 so i bought the 12 thinking i can always take it in if i have to. the 12 - which should have been big on me was tiny. this skirt is built for someone with non-existent hips. returning.
0,The sleeve detail is cute and well done. the fabric is nice quality  but the body of the shirt really doesn't have any shape.
-1,Very disappointed in this top. i have a short waist  and it was still too short for me. :-(
1,My daughter loved this tee the first time she tried it on. since then i have purchased the white  yellow/lemon and rose pink colors for her. the material is soft  it washes well and it looks great. she says these tees are some of the most comfortable she owns and it looks good with shorts  jeans and leggings.
0,I wanted this dress in wine for a holiday party. but it just has no life whatsoever. unlike prior reviewer  i found nothing to dislike about the fabric. the fabric is fine and the fit is fine. i'm sometimes an 8 and sometimes a 6; took this in an 8 and definitely would not size down. it's relatively close- and well-fitting  but the sleeves and neckline further ruined it for me. the sleeves are shapeless  long and baggy. the neckline is just blah. it needs to be neater  trimmer  more cut. the ruc
1,Love the length and long sleeves. so comfy to sleep in! great purchase  i ordered the navy one too!!
0,I really wanted to love this everything about this piece. especially after reading all of the great review i was so excited and looking forward to getting this dress. unfortunately it just did not work out. i ordered a large and it fit fine but the dress did not give me the faltering shape i had read about and was hoping for. it literally just hung on me and made me look wider. sadly i had to return this.
-1,I pretty much am in agreement with the first  original reviewer on here. big disappointment  especially if you have hips and are busty.  _____________  pros:  - great breathable fabric.  - cute look overall.  - sash in front brings it all together.  - buttons are hidden under a panel of fabric  which is a nice touch.  ____________  cons:  - runs very small in the bust. normally  i can wear a 10 or 12 with most of retailer's stuff. i tried on a 12 and it fit everywhere with entirely too much room i
0,This is a lovely  well-made piece by maeve  a longtime favorite of mine. the material is great weight and won't wrinkle  colors are vibrant  and design of the dress is cute  if a bit on the short side.    however  i  like some of the other reviewers  didn't love this this on me. the waist hit slightly above my natural waist (and i'm very short-waisted) and this particular sweetheart neckline did nothing to flatter my bust (i'm a 34dd for reference). the end result was a bit too dowdy on top with
1,"I ordered the red in size m. for reference i am 5'8"" with a long-ish torso. i would have been comfortable wearing the sweater with mid or high-rise jeans but it's fairly short. color was gorgeous. the balloon sleeves and seams just seemed too 1980s in a bad way on me. those with small chests may have better luck. i left like a suburban mom in it."
1,"Just a heads up because i didn't notice the pink in the blue motif print until it had arrived. almost sent it back - changes the overall aesthetic  makes it harder to layer in winter  black shoes stand out more etc... but i don't really like the orange print and i'm a red head... so i'm keeping it but it would have been amazing if it were cream and blue. i also bought the emerson swing dress. this dress runs tts (emerson runs a touch larger). i'm 5'5"" and the dress came to just barely above my k"
0,This dress looked like something i would wear and covet for years. unfortunately it was loose in the places where it should show shape and was tight in others. the bodice is incredibly small and not meant for bigger chested women. while the fabric is beautiful  overall the dress did not look like much. disappointed.
0,Beautiful pattern and shape! however i had to send it back! it is extremely see through and ran very small! i even sized up and it still pulled in the bust area! maybe someone with a smaller bust might fit them better!
-1,I love the color of this dress. it is not flattering  even though it should be. the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky. the lace is heavy but the silky panels aren't. so not flattering  it's just odd. and the fit is super huge  you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape. it could have been so cute  but was executed so poorly.
0,I like this shirt  want to love it. i am keeping this shirt hoping to have better arms by summer when i can where this top with black shorts. this shirt does cling  it's a draping sort of fabric; i love how it drapes in the front. only because i am not happy with my arms do i where a cardi with it. also  the underarm area is rather open so i'll wear a bandeau when i wear this without a cardi.
1,"I wear this out  but it's also a super comfortable to lounge around the house in. i measure 35"" 28"" 40"" (6 through the top  10 in the bottom). i ordered a medium based on comments from other users concerning the top and it being constricting. i didn't find that to be true  but for a closer fit i probably should have ordered the small. overall  this is a fun dress to wear."
1,Best beachy summer tunic in the store. can be worn knotted at the hip or worn straight. can be worn over jeans  shorts  a bathing suit  take your pick. wear it with a tank/cami underneath or not. it works wither way. asymmetrical cut. great for us long-legged tall people. fabulous buy. only con is that it's a tad delicate. unfinished hem and loose-knit. will easily snag if you aren't mindful. i recommend hand wash  air dry.
1,This caught my eye straight away and it hasn't disappointed on either. really unique and i imagine it will suit many different occasions. high quality and slimming vertical stripes too.
0,Snags very very easily.  i hadent even gotten to take the tags off and it rubbed against another item and snagged! so disappointed as it is a beautiful top  lovely color and beautifully detailed! i'm so disappointed i was hoping to keep it but will be sending it back.
-1,I ordered this dress online. the colors are pretty (if you like pastels) and the fit is true to size  however  it fits very much like a maternity dress. for those of you rocking a baby bump  this is a good choice. for others who are not  it's just not flattering. my figure got lost in the dress and the high waist did not look good on me. i returned it.
0,This cute dress was very nice on. however my only reservations were the thickness in the arm sleeves. the dress has this thick curtain like material on the sleeves that seemed to big and cut way to wide for my skinny arms. i thought about bringing this to the tailor but i feel it would be a lot of work and the bulkiness of the arms would just be the same.  other than that the colors and dress are beautiful.
-1,I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design  this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.
0,I love this shirt  in fact  i love all bordeaux tops from retailer. i followed the instructions to hand wash only and after it was wet and then lay flat to dry  it may fit a child. it is a belly top. i want to love this  but it shrunk so bad even with the hand wash only instructions.
0,I really wanted to love this sweater after reading all the reviews  but it just didn't work for me. the pattern is amazing (almost a little over powering  making it one of a kind and unique) but what i didn't like the color of the knit collar and front bands----it's an old looking mauve-tweed grandpa color. i probably would have kept it if that color was different. it was returned to find a different coat style sweater.
0,I found these to fit odd. i am also use to wearing the skinny jeans so trying a wide leg was a bit weird anyway. the placement of the pockets and the way it hit my waist was awkward and not flattering. i am usually a 8/10 and the 8 fit but just did not look good.
1,This is a lovely dress. it is on the heavy side and lined  so i would not recommend for hot summer wear. but the material and style are adorable. the skirt is definitely a-line  not sheath  but i prefer that. it runs a tad too tight in the chest  so if you're between sizes in the bust  i'd order up. that said  a 6 would be too big for me. i'm 5'4  120 lbs and 34c and usually wear a 4.
1,This color is gorgeous. this could be dressed up or down. great buy!
-1,I really wanted to love this  but it was just too voluminous to be flattering. i am typically a size 10 or 12 in dresses and jumpsuits  and the medium was billowing around me. also the elastic waist hit me low and bunched in an unflattering way. it had to go back.
0,These are the very stretchy  almost spongy  type fabric.  i ordered my usual size and they fit me like a sausage skin.  crazy small!!!
-1,Like most people here  i wanted this beautiful dress to fit. so  i decided to see for myself if maybe  just maybe the negative reviews were wrong. they weren't. if you have any sort of breasts at all  the top probably won't fit properly. i imagine a narrow upper torso  like a 32 or 33  possibly a 34 might find the top part of the dress closes properly  but with a 36 c  i could not get a size 12 to button up. the waist hit at a strange spot  and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad
1,I'm small (4'11  98 pounds and 34a) so the regular xs looks like a baby doll dress on me.  i just wear the tunic with a tank top underneath (or i can wear the tunic by itself) and leggings plus a pair of boots.  the top part is slightly baggy so if you want tight fitting  is size down to xxs.  i got the yellow flower and white + grey one and plan to get the navy one soon.  the quality is good and you can machine wash it with cold water.  i plan to use a tide sweater garment bag to wash it (i put
0,Fabric was a little more shear than i thought it would be - while not a big deal - it was missing a few of the silver beads along the front line of the top. returned
1,Great dress for a full figure. forget about the horizontal stripes. you can wear this with great style and get away with wearing those dreaded stripes. the possibilities have been great because i wear this dress with sweater vests  athletic vests  sweaters  jackets and wool scarves. i have worn this dress with cowboy boots  dress boots and pumps and it looks great with all options. the material is thick enough that panty lines don't show. women of different ages stop me and tell me they want thi
1,These tight cords are perfect for fall.
0,This thing sheds so much it's almost unuseable but i used an entire roll of sticky roller and got it to the point where i could wear it with only a glob of fuzz on my underwear not other people's couches. it's cute and fits well other than that. buy a sticky roller!
-1,I should have listened to the previous review on-line before ordering. unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off. i love uniquely shaped wraps like this  but this one didn't make the cut for me.
1,Love this sweater! not too long or bulky true to size. the fabric is super soft  great quality!
0,Material is a little think and they run a bit long like many other retailer pants. otherwise  a great deal if you get them on sale.
0,This was pretty to look at: nice weight  lining  colors. i tried it on and whoa. ridiculously bad. i have broad shoulders and a small waist and this accentuated the broadness of my shoulders and eliminated any hint of shape below that. the model photo looks great  so i imagine this will look great on anyone with slim shoulders and narrow hips. definitely not for me  though...
-1,I was extremely excited to receive these pants  given the two positive reviews. i'm a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions. i sized down from my normal size (27 to a 26) and was swimming in these pants. i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work. i'm not sure if i received a defective pair or what  but be cautious ordering these pants.
-1,As another reviewer noted  the upper portion (back  chest  shoulders  etc.) fit nicely. however  the body of the dress was enormous and did  indeed  make me look much heavier throughout the middle. back to the store it goes.
