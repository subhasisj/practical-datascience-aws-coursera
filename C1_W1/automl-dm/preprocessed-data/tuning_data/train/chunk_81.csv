1,I absolutely love this dress! the fabric is very light and airy while not being revealing. the color  being nude as indicated  is a nice change from plain white or off white and the embroidery is just beautiful and makes this dress quite unique. i love the fact that it is a tunic dress which lends to less of a structured look and more of an easy casual style. i recently wore this dress to an out door bbq and was both cool and comfortable all day. i also received many compliments from friends and
-1,I was really excited about this skirt because i love the color. however when i tried it on  it was too much of a high/low. i am not very tall but this would look a lot better on a tall person.
1,I really like these but my usual size 29 did not fit. i always wear that size in pilcro but these were at least a size two small and i have to return them. regretfully  they are out of size 30 so i lose out. wish there had been previous reviews to let me know  so i'm doing so now for anyone thinking of ordering.
1,"I am so in love with this dress. i think it is made of high quality fabric and very well designed. i am 5'6""  about 145lbs  34d and the 4 fit perfectly! i bought it for my upcoming bridal shower and could not be more excited to wear it!!"
1,What a perfect summer dress! after reading the previous review i ordered a size up and it's perfect. the slip is a little snug on the hips  but most dresses are on me so i think on most people it would fit very well as long as you ordered one size larger. i can't wait to wear this while traveling through europe next summer!
-1,I found the fit of this dress odd. i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. the 6 fit across the chest but the armholes were large so wearing a bra would be a challenge. i am a 34c so i need some type of support. i also thought the fabric was a bit flimsy for the price. i am a huge retailer fan and usually leave glowing reviews but sadly i left this one in the store.
0,The lining is shorter than the top  so i keep pulling it down. also the finishing of the edges looks like a child cut it with some scissors. it is not evenly cut. i do like the color and style of the shirt  just not the quality.
1,I paid full price for this cardigan and have not regretted purchase for one minute  having worn it almost every day this summer.  it is the perfect weight for cool summer evenings  seaside strolls  chilly restaurants  or  for a sunblock layer when you have to be outside.
0,I wanted to love this shirt but it quickly lost shape and a hole was created in the middle of the shirt after just a few washes. not worth the price. poorly made. you need to wear a shirt underneath bc it is so thin. the shirt looks better int he picture. i like it but it wears terribly.
-1,Agree with above review. these are described totally wrong. they are not 8.5 rise. they are very high rise  so much that i didnt even try them on...the color isnt good either  it looks like a cheap levi's color or just not a quality denim. if you like high rise  you might like them. i can't comment on fit..
-1,I love this jump suit.. sorta. looks great on but the dye rubs off on your skin. i washed it and its still happening. when you put your hand in your pockets  they come out blue  knees are blue  thighs  etc. i looked dirty by the end of the day. wish i could return it. fit and look great... not great after wear.
-1,These felt like they were cutting off circulation around the calves. i tried pulling them lower to reduce the tightness but that made them way too droopy between the legs. an alternative would be to clip the elastic  but ultimately decided to return.
-1,Material is thin  with a fleece like feeling on the inside. hard to describe but almost feels like a really thin north face material. the cut on the sides of chest area is super awkward  shows way too much  would never be appropriate to wear a regular bra underneath.
-1,I have always bought interesting  pretty  wearable dresses for my daughters at retailer. now the dresses are just retro funky. sad to see.
-1,I love the look of this sweater  but just bought and put on at home and noticed 2 pea sized holes in fabric  near arm holes  but not on seams. not sure if i bought this way and did not notice or if fabric is just incredibly delicate. will try to repair but scated this will not hold up... look it over carefully before you buy  they kind of look like moth holes...
-1,When i saw this blouse online i thought it was so cute! i love the floral detail. unfortunately it looks much cuter online than it does in person. it has no shape so it is not flattering to the figure. it might look better tucked in or partially tucked in as shown in the picture  but it did not look good completely tucked out. i was also not a fan of the fabric. in the picture the fabric looks dressier than it is. the front is more polyester and is a little dressier  but not what i envisioned. t
1,I had this on my birthday list and was really hopeful that it'd work out based on all of the good reviews. when i got it  i was happy with the fit and fabric  but i was stumped as to what i'd wear it with. it hung in the closet for a couple of weeks because i just didn't know if i could pull off the length. i took the plunge today and find it pairs nicely with a flared leg pant and simple shirt underneath. it's so stretchy  warm  and cozy! the sweater does shed as another reviewer mentioned so k
-1,"I am 5' 7"" - 110 lbs. ordered my normal xs and the bottom portion was way over sized. it fit like a parachute  you could fit about 12 of me in the bottoms and very short. nice quality material  but extremely awkward fit."
1,Got the wine color and love it! the design definitely is slimming! 5'1  120lb  got  size 4.
0,Giving 3.5 stars due to how big this dress runs. i am 5' 118lbs and i was swimming in the xs. it is a beautiful dress  just beware it runs very large.
0,This is a really cute shirt. i love the design  color and everything about this shirt but the size. i am 5'1 and 105 lbs  i can usually wear an xs or xsp. the xs was huge and they were sold out of smaller sizes or i would have ordered one. this unfortunately had to go back.
1,Love the lace on the back! it's a sweet take on a typical tee! comfy! a little on the boxier side but a great tee.
0,"I ordered this on line. pretty  but ran large so returning. i am 5'10"" and 140lbs.  not large chested  and the m was too loose and looked frumpy. the sweater is a very soft  loose  knit that requires a cami underneath as it is slightly sheer. it was not quite as soft as expected for cashmere but good value at sale price."
-1,"I might be the only odd person out there who think this jacket is not perfect at all. a lot of other reviewers said that the jacket runs small. for me  it's not true at all  i had to go to xxp petite to find the fit acceptable  but it was simply too short (rather than 20"" as it states on the website  it's more like 18"")  which is a thing i almost never experienced because i am a petite person! i don't even want to go regular size because it would've been too big. i saw some photos that others po"
-1,"I know this product description says oversized but that's an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father's jacket. i don't even think an xs would have worked. i'm 5'6"" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it's just way too big."
1,I bought this dress after i had overnighted a different one and it wasn't going to be delivered on time. i'm so happy that i bought this dress. its so comfortable and easy to wear. i got lots of compliments on it.  it runs very large though. i ended up with a size 6. i initially tried on the 10  as i have a larger chest. the 6 still had plenty of room.
1,This fit me perfectly with a little room but think it's meant to be this way so easier to get on and off. this feels like a dream and is very good quality. definitely a heavier piece but i like that. it is so very flattering and drapes beautifully to hide my tummy. the back is adorable too! retailer hit it out of park with this one! grab it before it's too late! i'm a 36ddd and size 14 and the large fit perfectly
-1,This is one of those you can tell from the hanger that it's not going to work. too boxy. too short. and the girlish ruffle makes it look like an over-sized child's shirt that got all messed up in the washing machine.
0,The fabric is super soft and the grey is pretty  but it is light grey not dark grey as described when you select to buy it. my biggest issue with the top is that the cold shoulder arm reveals the entire arm  so if you aren't completely toned with your tricep and all over arm  it will show... which is why i bought this to hide my blunders
1,This jacket is a real treasure and i could never have seen how substantial the embroidery is from the photo. also from the pic the jacket looks like a thin cotton  but on the contrary it is a wonderful weight with a feel like denim. the embroidery is a wonderful texture like heavy string or thin rope so it really has dimension... . i loved it so much i got the sweatshirt also by the same designer. can't wait until cooler weather so i may live in it! also when you have it on for a bit it seems to
0,I order this shirt because it looked like a shirt you could dress up or down. when i got it the shirt was really wrinkled. therefore  i knew it would have to ironed a lot. it was quite boxy and was shorter in the front then in the back. i didn't realize that this shirt was two different fabrics. overall i think this shirt would be more flattering on a woman that was petite.
0,I love this fabric  and the design details of this top. but i am only 5'3  and this top ends above my waist! shoulders and sleeves fit perfectly and the neck and back details are very flattering. i ended up keeping the shirt because i love the fabric so much  but i am trying to find a way to wear this shirt with how short it is. tucking in or wearing with high-waisted bottoms are all i can figure out  for someone without a perfectly flat tummy.
0,"I really like this shirt but it's a bit maternity. i don't mind some extra fabric around the stomach area but there is a lot here. i'm 5' 7"" about 125 and i think it makes me look like i might be hiding a little secret. since i'm done having kids  it has to go back.   it's also somewhat see through and had i kept it  i would have worn a tank top underneath.  as long as these things don't bother you  it really is cute!"
0,I ordered this online in the cream color and because some of the reviews mentioned the shorter back  i went with a medium  but that ended up running too big. i typically wear between a 4 and a 6 / small and medium so i'm always on the fence about which size to get. i often order both online and return the one that doesn't fit as well  so i wish i had this time too! the detail on the front is super cute and i didn't even mind the plainer back  but the sleeves went well past my wrist and i felt li
0,I wanted to love this dress so badly. it came and the material is beautiful  but when i put it on it fit so awkwardly. there was just no way to make it look good. maybe i needed a smaller size  but oh well.
-1,Didn't work on this curvy gal.  sizing up would have helped with the button gaps  but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.  major pass.
0,"I absolutely loved the idea of an elongated hoodie as a lounge dress or robe. unfortunately  this particular product left a lot to be desired. firstly  the fit is slim  not relaxed. i'm 5'4""  at 110 lbs and tried both the size 1 (equivalent of a small) and size 2 (equivalent of a medium). sizing up just added length and did not do much to increase roominess. they both zipped up easily but did not drape well. finally  the fabric was really not welcoming. i prefer terry over fleece  however this w"
1,This sweater in the yellow caught my eye several times and i finally tried it on! so cute and perfect for transitional weather. threw it over the striped top that was hanging in the changing room. ended up with both!
0,Lovely palette and and fabric but the cut did not flatter my shape. the flowy cut broadened my silhouette and hit at my waist making me look bigger than i actually am. the overall effect was quite frumpy in spite of the flamboyant pattern. perhaps a better choice for someone built exactly like the model.  i will be returning it.
-1,"I purchased this swimsuit in the mint. gorgeous color combination. i'm 5'5"" and weigh 117 lbs. i purchased a small. the fit is true to size. i love the front design; however  my husband promptly brought the back of the swimsuit to my attention. the chevron was off center. the design should have been centered with my back; however  it was on the right side of my back. i immediately called retailer assuming the product was defective. the item was sold out on line; however  a supervisor was able to l"
1,"This is a really nice top  especially for the price. i am 5'6""  34dd  140 lbs and normally wear a medium in dolan tops. in this top i purchased size small since the gathered front provides ample room for my bust. some reviewers have found this top to be on the ""boxy"" side. i can see that if you don't size down as i did. i found the medium to have too much fabric and look very baggy whereas the small was perfect. i do wish this top was a tad bit longer and less sheer  though. white tops should be"
-1,Ordered this dress in an xs  that is the size i usually wear. this runs small  but not only that it is the way it is cut  very small through the hips  thighs and legs. hard to walk in it. the material felt kind of cheap to me. i thought it looked really good on the model  but got it home and didn't like it at all! it went back!
0,I really liked the style of this top but it's way oversized! i'm petite and drowned in this top even though i got it in an xs. the material is nice but i can't see i had a feeling for the cut because it runs so big. this one is going back to the store!
0,Nice color and great work but runs little large.
0,Not for the curvy women. fit in the waist but bunched around the crotch
1,Such a gorgeous weight  cut and style! the button detail is adorable and the fit of the sweater is fantastic. the hem style  (not sure what you would call it)  is incredibly flattering for an hourglass figure. i am 5'4  133 and 34dd. fit is tts  maybe a bit large but nothing crazy. love
-1,"This nightgown looked so comfy and cute! i ordered a large and it was so uncomfortably tight.i'm 5'3"" and 150lbs. it was such a shame. size large should not just be really a medium!"
1,This sweater is so beautiful on. it is thick material  but does not make you look boxy. it fits so nicely and is flattering. the design is just gorgeous. if you are considering this sweater-- get it  you won't regret it!  i'm normally a small (4-6) and i ordered a small. it fits true to size. the fit is *perfect* so if you want it slightly more relaxed  order one size up.
-1,I was so sad not to love this dress. it is beautiful  but is so unflattering on. there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking. so  it just made me look incredibly frumpy. i don't really think a petite would have helped - the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang  the dress sort of clumps. i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem  but i was super disappointed. narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off. it is a t
1,I love this top! the arms fit slender but the rest of the top is a nice loose fit. i love the navy blue one with the print  i normally don&#39;t like long tunics but it&#39;s so flattering even for my short frame! i&#39;m usually a medium on top and bought the medium which was perfect.
0,I purchased these in a 26 petite and a 26 regular. the 26r was too long and bunched up terribly pass the knee. they were also loose in the waist and overall body. the 26p fit great in the waist and body  however; past the knee it was too tight and again it bunched but not as bad as the 26 reg. the overall quality of the jean seems fairly good. the fit just did not work for me so these go back and the hunt continues for white jeans. would love it if they made the hyphen jeans in white.
1,This coat is super yummy! i'm always in need of something stylish and warm at the same time. definitely was happy with the weight and lining on this garment.  *highlight: i always get compliments on it when i'm out.
0,I ordered this shirt in the purple stripe and was happy when it arrived and i really liked the color and style.   however  like the other reviewer  when i tried it on  the little circles on the front line up perfectly with your bra straps.  i even tried a different style bra and had the same result.  sadly i returned it yesterday.
-1,I know this is supposed to look oversized  and i own a few oversized ponchos  but this takes oversized to a whole new level.  i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric - i do not think sizing down would have made a difference.  if you are looking for that  it seemed like good qualify.
-1,I bought the shirt in ivory and went down a size per the advice from other reviewers. what i should have done was go down 2 sizes! runs huge! my husband said i looked pregnant and that's never a good look if your not. sent this back the same day.
0,This skirt and top is nothing like the picture. the skirt is black not maroon. top is also black. although the skirt is nice  the image was fabulous. the side panels of the skirt are also a knit. quality is good but skirt is overpriced for what it is. would have expected suede or leather panels for the money. not sure if going to keep or not. was really looking for the maroon color instead of the black.
1,I was looking for a white shirt to layer with this winter. this shirt looks great on its own  but it has also done great as a long sleeved layer under vests  etc. it's a little thin so i only gave it 4 stars for quality  but it is holding up well so far.
0,"I have purchased many different styles of pilcro jeans  and have loved them all!!! these  unfortunately i do not like. i think they run large and the fit  just blah. the waist gapped and kinda had a ""mom jean"" look. i felt the quality was also not up to standard for this brand."
1,I saw this duster and immediately ordered it in cream. i have worn it every chance i get. it goes well with dresses as well as shorts or jeans. the length is perfect  the design is flattering  and the material is soft and comfortable. the sleeves are snug- but i like this feature  especially for light weight summer use over a tank top or sleeveless blouse. this will be a go to item. thanks retailer- another gem!
1,Beautiful top and beautiful bright color. this does run 2 sizes small in arms and chest unless you are very narrow in stature and flat chested . i am usually a size 6 and a 36c and broad shoulders and size 10 just its in underarm area. i have short torso so love the length but those with very long torso may find this blouse too short. if you get the right size this topics really adorable. my husband also gave it a big thumbs up.
1,Love the coral color - so pretty in person. it is slightly lower cut on the chest than i expected.   this is a great top for the weekends!
0,This piece is lovely if you do not plan to use your arms  or if you are a t-rex. if you are not a mannequin or a dinosaur and actually plan to use your arms  this top may not be for you.
-1,This top seemed so unique online  but in person it was really nothing like the pics. super full  shorter cut. the quality wasn't what i thought it would be. i will gladly pay for nice quality fabric and unique prints anyday... but this wasn't any of those things..
0,"I've been looking for some new  casual tops and ordered this one for the sky blue color. i'm a size 6 and the small fits great. i don't find the blowzy style overwhelming. i am small boned but i'm 5'8""  not a petite. i like it with leggings and skinny jeans ...a nice proportion. however  i can see how this cut may be too much on someone with a smaller frame. i really like it  however i see two drawbacks: the material is a bit thin for fall and it wrinkles very easily (not good for travel). this"
-1,I so wanted to love this suit. it was gorgeous - the color  the quality  the style  but i am returning and can not recommend it. the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work  but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front. i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun  but i didn't feel like i could even walk safely  and i am not well-endowed. very bummed but it's going back.
-1,Runs very large. ordered a smaller size due to other reviews but should have ordered several sizes smaller
0,"I have other pairs of stevie jeans and looked forward to receiving these.i would say that they run about a size large compared to my other pairs. i am 5'2"" and ordered a petite  but i found the length to be about 2-3 inches too long. as compared to how they look on the model. also  the rise is relatively low. otherwise  the quality is great  and the denim is very soft. i will probably return these given that i am not wowed."
1,I picked this dress up to take into the dressing room to try on without looking at the price tag. im typically a small and he dress in store was an xs but because of the wrap i figured i'd try it anyway. this dress is to die for! the xs fit me just fine (though the snap at the chest wouldn't stay closed but i thought it looked ok). i looked at the tag after falling in love with the dress but left the store without it. i'm contemplating purchasing it still because i can't stop thinking about it!!
1,Love the fabric  print  and cut! it's a smidge low in the neckline  but that's probably because i'm busty. nice and breezy for our blazing hot and humid florida summers.
0,So this is a great tee  problem is the white you can see through. i an not looking for a layering tee so not what i was looking for.
