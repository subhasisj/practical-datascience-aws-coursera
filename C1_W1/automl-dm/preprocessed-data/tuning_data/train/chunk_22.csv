-1,I love the dress as shown in the photo. thankfully i had a chance to see the dress in the store. it is sheer. can see thru it. can not wear this to work.
-1,I had such high hopes for this shirt! i got it in both the black and moss (which is a beautiful color). however  the ruffle was just too big. i put it on and immediately felt like a circus clown. it would probably be beautiful on a woman with a more straight figure with fewer curves  but on me  it was not flattering at all.
0,Love this blouse  however upon every time i wear it  a new button pops off. i have had to replace every button!
0,I want to like and keep. at this price point i cant justify keeping. if it does go to clearance i will reorder. due to the thin material it seems more summery and casual than what i was anticipating. true to size. i ordered a medium and am 5'9 and 155 pounds.
0,The blue has three colors of stripes: blue  white and black 9between white and blue). the black stripe made it too busy for me. the material is soft and clingy. i followed the advice of previous reviewer and sized up to a m (normally wear s). the shirt fit as pictured on the model  not tight but form fitting.
-1,These look much cuter in the picture than in person. i found them to be very thin and cheap looking. i am pretty sure you could find a similar pair at a budget department store.
1,Buy it. buy it right now! this dress is gorgeous  and would be on anyone. i don't care what size you are  it's so pretty  that you feel pretty in it! i loved wearing it  and since i am in florida  i can wear it all year long. so it's worth it. happy  very happy  with this purchase!
-1,I went with my usual size  but it is too tight  it fits  but i would feel uncomfortable in it. i ordered the pink one  which looks nice in the picture  but in person  it looks cheap. the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s. that beaded neckline added to the cheap look. this one is not for me.
1,This is so beautiful and looks hand made but in a really good professional way. this will be a perfect fall wardrobe addition and i can't wait to wear it with a long sleeve top and jeans and boots. it's not too long and it is very flattering and soft and drapes well. love it.
1,The fabric is breathtaking  both the jewel tone colors and the burnt velvet that would flatter any skin tone. as usual  eva franco clothes run small so i went up a size  size regular 6 (i am 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips) fit well  the hem is below my knees  appropriate for work. but i think it would look better as a skirt or a sheath dress. the top part looks strange  does not enhance any curve and turns the dress to frumpy on short folks like me  thus one star off.
0,Dress looks awesome when your arms are down like the model. but don't you dare lift your arms. i'm kinda tall and the dress barely covers my bum when arms are raised. keeping the dress but will have to keep my arms down ;) maybe?
0,This is definitely a personal preference review. i loved this dress when i tried it on. it's really beautiful. however  there was just way too much fabric on the sleeves for me. i know it's the style and i have similar style dresses  but i felt really large in this dress and it all came down to the sleeves for me.
1,Love this top! not too low cut  drapes nicely and the material is thin enough but not so thin you have to wear a tank top. it does seem to run on the larger side.
-1,Dear retailer & designers:  just want a nice dress that isn't made from polyester! don't mind paying bigger bucks for quality fabrics  but please- enough of the polyester!   love   your customers
0,Bought it on sale and i am keeping it. it is well made an the material seems to be of good quality. however  i believe this would be more flattering on someone less curvy - less hips  smaller bust - as it makes me look slightly pregnant. still  i am keeping it to use on those days i just don't feel like dressing up for work. i bought a large (i'm a 36-38c)  but i think i could've gotten away with a medium.
1,This top is sold out in my size online but i was fortunate enough to snag one in the store. great top that can be dressed up or down. the ruching across the front is very slimming. tried the top with skirts and pants -- looks great with everything! i usually wear a size small in deletta tops but sized up to a medium to accommodate my chest (i am a full c cup). i highly recommend this purchase.
1,This cream sweater is a great addition to your wardrobe. the length hits below the waist and the zipper adds an updated touch to the look. is a bit itchy but there's room for a light layer underneath.
0,I ordered this online and was completely underwhelmed in person. the pattern didn't pop at all and the fit was just ok. it kind of bunched weird in the breast area. i usually love plenty but this is a return.
-1,I wanted to love this top. perfect weight  length  and shape. unfortunately  the seam goes right through the bust and just does not look right. if you are tiny on top  this will be lovely on you.
-1,There isn't a whole lot that i did like about this dress. the shoulders have large poufs  the fabric isn't very soft  and it's not flattering. maybe with a belt i could be tempted  but i wasn't too fond of the dress.
0,I tried this on in the store - i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight. the material was a little itchy on me (but maybe its because the chest was tight). the color is lovely (pink). im sure someone will love it but if you are petite  i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty.
1,The petite was a little bit long on me (i'm 5'2)  but it otherwise fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable  breezy. covers enough that it is work appropriate or for something outside. a keeper!
-1,"I purchased this dress in the green  and while the print and material were lovely  the extra folds in the neckline made the dress look frumpy up top. the billowly bottom made it look like a bag. i am 5ft  36d and 29"" waist and the size 2 fit  which makes me think this runs large! i'll be returning this dress."
0,I really wanted to love this  but the length of the pants was so awkward and dowdy. if they were longer or shorter  this would be a win. nice fabric  not too clingy so it is attractive on top and hips.
0,I always have to try on tops of retailer. i know this  and yet i ordered a top through the website anyway. i don't think i'll do it again. the drape of the top seen in the pictures did not translate in real life because the top scratched up pretty quickly. ironically  when i washed it (according to directions) it also shrunk quite a bit.
-1,Thought i would splurge on a tracy reese coat. i got a size small  (120  5'6) felt huge on me and i looked like a wooly mammoth. very unflattering. another reviewer also mentioned on how it flairs slightly at the bottom?.adding to the overall bad look. i had it on for about 20 seconds and put it back in the bag to return. din't have to ponder about it at all.
-1,The shirt does have a weird yellow tinge as other reviewers have described. i could get over that if the shirt was a flattering fit which it was not. not worth the money so i returned it.
1,Love this skirt ! i thought it would be much shorter but when i tried it on it was the perfect length and super cute!! the material is thick but not uncomfortable and very move able!
0,I love this blouse  i've received so many compliments on it. unfortunately i just got it back from the dry cleaners and the color completely changed to a pale yellow! it also ate away some of the fabric  so now it's completely transparent... and i go to an organic cleaners!     retailer: if you can fix the fabric quality this blouse would be a classic.
-1,I'm a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit  the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i'm not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn't lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo
1,I thought these were great everyday shirts for the price. i got them on sale over christmas. they fit well and i really love the striped shirt. the navy is an odd color and looks strange with jeans but i love the top regardless
1,I got this planning to wear to a wedding  but have dressed it up for a gala event and down with a white sleeveless top to an awards ceremony. i've definitely gotten some mileage out of it! like the other reviews said  it is long  but was able to easily trim excess fabric from the bottom and it works perfect with wedges. love it!
1,I am not sure why so many gave only 3 stars  yes  this top is for a strapless bra  my bra top (where the strap starts  0 was showing  but so nice... shape was ok for me  it does go in at the hem  givinng a bubble-like shape  but it's part of the charm. i dnd't experience the loose straps  but didn't pay attention to that when i tried it on. also didn't notice the stitching was red in the store  but checked  and yes  that's true... love it.    not an online exclusive  as it was in my store  i pur
0,Beautiful top marred only by the armholes. i tried a small and a medium but alas  my bra showed under the arms. i my be overly endowed for this top  but the way it cuts  you would have to be braless to wear it. not for me  but wish it worked. it is really pretty.
-1,I was so excited to splurge on a mara hoffman suit and was sorely disappointed when i received this suit in the mail. i'm petite and fairly curvy  so i knew it would likely be a little long in the torso but the whole suit was so oddly shaped  i couldn't imagine anyone it would fit. the square shape in between the halter pieces is awkward  and the pieces that are supposed to hold your chest are super wide and loose.
1,I thought these were pretty on the website  but in person they look like a work of art! the colors are vivid -- bright reds  pinks  greens  blues  yellow -- with flora  fauna  houses  writing  type and so many other things on a white and cream background. they are very soft  medium-weight flannel. for me they run true to size. i wish they had pockets  though!
-1,I wanted to love this dress - and did from the picture online. when it arrived  the black already looked faded and old. also  the embroidery looks like a grandma  but not in a cute vintage way. the fabric is stiff  which causes a boxy  unflattering look. had to return it.
1,Everything about this blouse is perfect - the color  the drape  the detail. so flattering and easy to wear. i just love it!
1,This blouse is so pretty! i love the design  the material  and the pattern is so unique. i love the sleeves and how they billow out just above the elbow and come in at the wrist. i think the amount of fabric is perfect and would not be nearly as nice with less. the cut around the top where it starts to gather and fall is so feminine and modern princess-feeling. i hope they make this same style in other colors and prints!!! i adore it and feel so good wearing it! if i could change anything  i'd m
0,"I saw this dress in our store and immediately walked over to check it out. it is quite a stunning piece. i purchased it without trying it on and wished i would have. unfortunately  there is entirely too much material in the bodice. it was overwhelming on me. for reference i am 5 ""3 and i do wear an xs but i am muscular and not thin. i think it would work well on somebody taller or leggier who could balance out the amount of material in the dress."
0,The color and embellishment of this top are beautiful. this would look great on anyone super lean  otherwise you just look really wide as there is no frame in the torso of this top at all. the back picture shows it well. i am 5'9  142 lbs and i ordered the small and medium and both were huge! with regrets going back.
0,Very cute and high-quality dress but it is very short. the length wouldn't be that much of an issue except for the fringe (which is awesome and unique  by the way) hits right at the butt. wish this dress (and  subsequently the fringe) was 3 inches longer.
1,I tried this on at my local store and immediately had to buy it. the picture does not do it justice. it drapes wonderfully in front and sticks out a bit at the pockets to give some added personality. fabric is very soft and light weight. highly recommend!
-1,I'm always looking for pieces that would good for either layering or worn alone. this looks cute on the model  but when i received it  it's actually very flowing. i wanted more of a straight cut. doesn't work very well on my body. i'm 5'3  123 lbs.  34-d. it's going back.
0,I had high hopes for this top  as it looked great online. unfortunately it was much more ruffly in person and not my style at all. it was a lot of fabric and poofed out too much -- reminded me of a child's top. sad to return it!
0,These pants are lovely and comfortable  but they are entirely too delicate. i wore them once and nearly any time something touched them  they snagged. i was worried about it when i saw the fabric  and thought i'd give it a try  but i didn't think it would be this bad. for the price  i expect better quality. also  they run a little large- unless i pull the waist down low  it gaps in the back and these look better worn a little bit higher  closer to the natural waist. i'm usually a 4/6  28/29 in b
-1,This might look good on you if you are very tall and slim. i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering  it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places. the color is not true: it is black stripes on gray (not cream). i thought the stripes might flatter my shape  but alas  i did not look good in this.  the material is very nice  soft and stretchy.
0,I love the idea of ruffles  but this shirt was huge! i normally wear a small or medium  and i got the small. it felt more like a large to me. maybe if you size down 1-2 sizes  it will work out for you. i'm going to take it back rather than exchange. i also wish it was a more lightweight material for summer  but it's pretty thick.
0,Based on the photos  i thought this dress would be very flattering on an hourglass shape. i ordered the faded reddish pink color. the color was true to the photo and very pretty and soft. the dress has an open neckline  fitted waist and skirt length that are all flattering  but the fabric is thin and clingy  making the dress overall not flattering on anyone not as thin as the model. it certainly doesn't hang. i believe it runs true to size. i'm generally a xs/s and i ordered a s and the fit was
0,I took a chance on this top because i loved the color and print. it is mostly as pictured  but because i have a larger chest  the peplum didn't hit me in the right place. it would probably work fine for someone thinner with a smaller chest. i was surprised that it was also somewhat sheer  which was disappointing considering the price. i returned it.
0,I am undecided if i will keep this dress or not. i am 5/4  155 lbs and ordered both the small and medium. the medium was comically large on me  with broad shoulders and a sack-like appearance. but the small fit very well and felt very french girl chic. the brownish-greenish color is really stunning in person  like a greenish copper. and the gathered sleeves elevate this into a dressier look. but the material is sheer  so you would need to wear a slip  and the elastic waist still has somewhat of
-1,Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy. it must be pinned in the picture online. it's very frustrating when they do that. thank goodness i didn't pay for shipping! for reference  i'm 5'2 and 135 pounds and bought the xxs  it's going back for sure. i'm trying to lose baby weight  not trying to look pregnant!
-1,No. this is one of the most unflattering things i've ever put on my body. i'm a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge. don't do it.
-1,Way too long...the sizing is incredibly off on this product. order a size or two down.
1,I am still on the fence with this one. i got it sort of as an impulse buy when i was buying some tops at my local store the other day. the piece is gorgeous and looks great over a black tank top. it is very versatile in that you can wear it so many different ways; as an accent piece over a t-shirt  bathing suit cover up  over a dress. it is a delicate material so i'm sure you have to be careful washing it  but it has a feminine  flowy style that is very unique. the only thing that i'm not sure o
1,I've only worn the sweater a handful of times  but i'm already in love with how soft and comfortable it is. it's a bit on the baggier side  but that doesn't stop it from looking great. i've gotten complements on it every time i've worn it. i would highly recommend it to people who don't like the typical scratchy/itchy textiles.
0,Those pants sit pretty snug on top and get very wide very fast. this looks odd in my opinion if you do not wear a tunic style top like on the picture. also the material is quite thin  which makes the snug part look unflattering. they were not for me unfortunately.
1,"So pretty. 5'4"" 115 lbs and the xs fits perfectly."
-1,I'm not sure what it is with ag. i own at least a dozen pairs of their jeans  in blue  black and white denim. i wish i could say they're all great  but unfortunately there's a big variation in how they wash  depending on the fabric content. i just purchased these because i love the lighter wash for spring  but after washing them once i can see they won't be a favorite pair. even with cold water and hanging them to dry  the fabric bunches weirdly and the shape of the leg changes. at this price po
0,"For me  at 5'9""  the top was not long enough...it appeared longer in the photo. i'll be returning it. other than length  it is cute."
1,As the other reviewers stated  it does run large  i sized down 1 size and it's perfect. great dress to wear so many ways.
0,I bought these for a trip to the caribbean. i sweat a lot. if you have ever been humiliated by having a ring of sweat around your crotch area  then i do not recommend these shorts in the moss color. this color and fabric do not camouflage sweat. i will spare you the photos.
-1,I loved the look of this sweater  but the workmanship was surprisingly poor. there were missed stitches  and loose threads throughout  and even a tag sewn to the outside. retailer was great about the return. i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed.
-1,I wanted to like this one.. really but it was just plain sloppy looking. i returned it.
-1,I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail! when it arrived  i was very disappointed. the color is more mauve than dusty pink  and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled.....not at all what i expect velvet to be (flowy and soft). the fabric seems very cheap for the price point.  i usually like floreat  but this one is headed right back to the store!
1,I loveeeeeeee this dress! i saw it online and immediately loved the blue/ orange large floral print but so did everyone else and it sold out quick. but i thought the shape could be flattering so i ordered in the black polka dot and loved the shape! so flattering. i ended up going in store and buying the other two colors. the patterns are vibrant and lovely shape. my only concern was seeing it in store i noticed it stretching while just hanging on the hanger. i wish the fabric was of better quali
1,"I purchased this dress in the berry color. it is beautiful and feminine. the length fit just like in the picture. i love all the detail and ease of this dress. i'm 5'2"" 34d and purchased a size 2. it fits true to size."
1,This shirt is so cute with skinny jeans and crossbody bag! i am 34b so i did not have the issue with the cut of top at the bustline. love it!
-1,"If you are thinking about purchasing this dress without trying on in person  i bet you aren't going to be happy with it. for a phisique that is 5' 3"" and 115lbs  this dress is not too short. however  the back key hole design is just not flattering. i felt like clothes in the back shoulder area is not fitted well and the zip up closure is not all the way zipped up even though it was so."
1,Great sweater. cozy and thick. the bands at the waist and wrists help keep this sweater in place. the loopy knitted fabric adds a bit of texture to the gray which makes it a little more exciting than your average gray sweater. i got a small and it fit perfectly.
