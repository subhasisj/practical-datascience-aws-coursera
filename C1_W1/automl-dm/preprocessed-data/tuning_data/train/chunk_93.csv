0,This model looks like a bauble head. she is absolutely too thin and sends the wrong message out to retailer shoppers. this last catalog's models are anorexic and unhealthy looking.    i ordered this shirt hoping it would fit  but it's too small for 34dd. i am tall athletic and have breasts.   i think of my shape as average - and the top didn't fit. it's cut narrow and small.
-1,I really wanted to love this piece but it was very large. i'm 5'2 and ordered xs/s and i have return due to size.
-1,"I ordered these because of the side zipper  but they zip in front  even though the order listing and bag label called them ""wine  side zip pants."" they were also at least two sizes larger than marked and very flimsy material. what bothers me is that i was charged $5.95 to send them back  even though the product description (and the name before someone changed it on the website) were wrong."
-1,I initially saw this top a few months ago  and fell in love. it ended up selling out in stores  so i ordered it online  where it was back-ordered by a couple of months. i received it this past week  and was sadly disappointed. the design is pretty  but overall the quality is sorely lacking. i wonder if maybe the first batch was good  but when they realized they were so popular  and had more made  the newer batches weren't as good? not sure. the one i got had inconsistent red embroidery  and ther
-1,I had a dress that felt like this in 1993. it jiggles  even if you don't. no amount of spanx can cure a dress jiggling of its own accord. the neckline that i had thought would be classic instead veered into frumpy. all in all i felt like it belonged in a discount store surrounded by polyester brethren.
0,I really couldn't tell if i like the dress or not - it was swimming on me and i always wear a size small. design is great with cross straps in the back  thin  silky fabric. i would call the color more of a bright coral/orange - not a bright red.i'll get back if i decide to try ordering the xs. . .
0,"The suit is beautiful  however the white it is slightly see-through on the bottom front. even though it is slight  to me that is inappropriate...so i returned it. regarding sizing  i ordered a medium  i usually wear a size 6 (135lbs) and my body is evenly proportioned throughout. the medium was not tight at all but the back bottom region seemed cut just slightly less than ""full coverage"". i feel that i would be in-between sizes small and medium but did not try a small due to the slightly transpa"
-1,I loved everything about this dress. the fit  the style and the ability to wear in the fall. i wore it once  washed it in gentle/hand-wash cycle  in cold water and laid it out flat to dry- per the instructions- and it shrank at least a full size. it's going back. i am so sad  as i said earlier  i really loved this dress.
1,Got these in the red brick color  and unfortunately had to send them back. these are really cute and i loved the color and pattern  but they ran very small  and the cut between the legs and hips was odd. this may not have been a problem had i gone up at least one size. best to try them on if possible.
-1,I ordered this because the reviews were outstanding. i am returning it. although the embroidery looks fine on screen  in person it looks cheap and tacky. moreover  the high ruffled neck goes a step too far -- into over-the-top victorian cutesy.  overpriced  to boot.  obviously  mine is a minority opinion.
-1,I bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg. i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage. just washed both pairs according to care instructions (no spills  stain remover  or anything but detergent) and both came out with light spots all down the leg. very sad to have wasted all that money.
-1,Runs small. i'm usually a size sm for retailer clothing (for reference  i'm 5'4  129lbs  36b). the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist. i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large. pretty  vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes.
1,"Clothes generally tend to look great when you're svelte. hence thin models. i've recently put on a few pounds (normally a 4-6  xs  small in retailer  5'6"" and i have boobs) and when i get lazy and eat a little too much i get it around the middle. i already have a chest so that makes finding clothes to look flattering harder bc the boobs create the apple effect. all that said just to make the point that this is a flattering sweater. i grabbed it last minute on the way to the dressing room  but i ne"
1,I wasn't overly impressed or drawn to this dress at first  even after i bought it  but after wearing it  i am sold! i paired the orange version with caramel colored sandals and gold jewelry. i thought it was necessary to wear a long necklace to bring some interest to the otherwise plain top. the dress is super comfortable - fabric  fit and length. it billows in such a pretty way when you walk! the color also made my skin look extra tan  which i loved! the waist is short and rides up now and then
-1,Way too big and had a granny like styling. was very excited but ultimately took it back.
-1,This top is gorgeous and i exchanged it 3 times hoping it would work. i originally got the size a would normally wear (a 6).and the arm holes and top were extremely tight and the top was short so i sized up and still had the same problem. i then went all the way up to a size 14 in order to get the length of the shirt log enough but now it is quite large around my hips. i love the detailing of the shirt but unfortunately if you have any chest at all it will not fit
0,I was excited to nab this lovely because i am a sucker for a faux layered look. i am usually an xs or s  depending on the designer so i went with xs in this top based on reviews that it doesn't drape well. i barely got my arms into the sleeves. i thought maybe it was a mistake and i received a child's size?  i eventually did get it on but barely got it back off. size up 1-2 for comfort if you have to have this girl. i was bummed my local retailer did not have a m for me to try. returned.  for ref:
0,"The tag on the jeans said ""won't stretch out""  and i've already returned one pair to size down when they stretched out by the end of the first wear. ive been wearing the smaller size for a week  and it's stretching out as well. the crotch ends up dropping two or 3 inches and i keep having to hike the pants up in public  after just a week of owning them. i love paige jeans  and the cut and color of these are amazing. i'm going to have to size down one last time just to get them to stay up  i hope"
1,This top is my go-to running errands top on the weekends  its super comfy and not to warm to wear throughout all the seasons. runs true to size and i get a bunch of compliments on the quality!
0,It's just ok. very thin and feel like it might say and stretch. color is very nice but much thinner and sheer we than what i wanted.
-1,I really liked the look of the orange so ordered an xs. i prefer a s petite but it is sold out. the xs arrives and while i still like the color  the fit is really weird. the cowl is very high up but the sleeves are still long. it looks nothing like the photo. i cannot see how the cowl sits on the model's collar bone. despite eliding the color  the design is off so have to return.
1,Absolutely adore this dress and plan onwearing it to a wedding. it is so well made and luxurious  i feel amazing in it! even more gorgeous in person
-1,I don't normally write reviews  but this shirt was so terrible  that i felt inspired.     first off  the seam that is in both the front and back of the shirt is much more pronounced than in the photo. secondly  there is no shape whatsoever  unlike in the photo. it bells out like a tent. it honestly looks like a shirt you would buy if you were trying to appear pregnant when not. overall  this shirt is an insult to the female form.     retailer  what is with all of these shapeless  frocks in cheap f
1,"I bought this dress in gray in a size 4. i am usually a size 6  even an 8 in maeve  so i said this dress runs a tad large. it is soft and easy to wear--throw it on and go. i think it looks best with a belt but that's my opinion. i am 5' 8.5"" tall  and this is a midi length on me. plenty long. not sure how it will wash. i think a fabric steamer will be needed. all in all  very pleased."
1,"In accordance with other reviewers  the pictures don't do this gorgeous lightweight sweater justice; the fabric has threads of gold  silver  and black that together make for shimmery elegance--not at all the heather grey in the photo.. i'm 5' 8"" 120 34b and the xs (regular) fits perfect--and actually more slimming/fit than in the photo. sleeves are long--which i love. a keeper  especially on sale!"
1,I ordered a medium as the large in the store was a bit too big. i wore this dress to a casual dinner at the grill in the country club and felt so cute  but also comfortable. i think it is a flattering dress shape and fabric. looks just like pictured on your website.
-1,I'm too tall for this. back goes halfway up my back. cannot do much with it other than front tie. fabric is not soft at all. not impressed. returned it.
0,My first complaint is  this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around (not all the way)  you can see the pin in the back.  that should have been a clue that this dress isn't meant to fit anyone properly if it doesn't fit the model. i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long.  you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top  or the fabr
0,This caught my eye and i tried it on the in the store today (the green). i found it to run a little bit large - i expected the small to fit  but the xs fit me better (better fit in armholes and also less billowy). i really like the way it looks  but ulitimately did not purchase it today. i might reconsider on sale. the flaws (in my opinion) are that it is dry clean only  the skirt is not lined (and should be)  and it's a bit overpriced for the quality. but on the other hand  it's very cute and f
1,Yes! yes! yes!   i buy a lot of dresses from retailer  and about once a year i hit the jackpot with a dress that hits all the marks! this dress is it!    i bought the white linen version on a whim. i never buy white dress because  1. i don't want to look bigger than my pear shape already is  and 2. i like red wine and i that's risky in a white dress!     i don't know how this designer did it  but this dress is amazing! it's slimming and flattering and summery and current. and i am two sizes bigger
1,I was running low on good summer shorts and thought i'd try these based on having a pair of the pilcro cropped pants i got a couple months ago. i tried these shorts on in-store to make sure they fit right and that i liked how they looked but then bought them online (more colors were available in my size than what they had in store). i bought these in 3 different colors and i absolutely love them all! they are my go-to shorts now  they look good with the legs rolled up or down  and i will be wear
0,I liked this top (in black)  but it didn't fit me well. had to return.
1,I love this skirt. it fits perfectly. great to transition from work to after-work event. very comfy. got lots of complements.
0,I loved the look of this tunic. it is made well and very pretty. it was so big and heavy i had to return it. i think the small in this would be too big.
-1,Just piping in here -- ordered my usual size of small petite. the slip that came with the dress is about a size negative zero  it could hardly squeeze over my body and the dress itself is a bright pale aqua and it is a shift. and because of the smocking it hangs very strangely. i think it looks very cheap and is ill fitting. i would say if you are a person on which shift dresses look awesome you might like this  but mind the size of the slip in the petites range  and also it is aqua.
0,"I do not love these pants. while the fabric is nice  they make me look rather dumpy. i highly recommend the essential taper pant instead  which has beautiful tapering legs and made me look more slender. these pants make me look like i've put on 20 pounds and they also make me look rather squat. perhaps they would look good on someone tall  but at 5' 6"" these are a miss for me!"
1,These bottoms are comfortable  soft and fit perfectly. the pattern is exactly the colors online.
1,I don't own any peach outerwear because i didn't think it would complement my skintone. this cozy bomber proved me wrong. wonderful quilting pattern and a vintage dye job that's eye catching. great for layering and the color goes with my autumn and spring wardrobe. this is not a fitted style  it's relaxed and a bit poufy at the sleeves and waist  just like a regular bomber jacket. i chose medium petite and it fits just right. i'm a 36d  135#  38-28-35.
0,This shirt is so cute. i ordered a white  but will have to return it for a different color. the white is very sheer/shee through!
-1,Even on sale sale...this tank is not worth the money. the design in the back is adorable & would expect it to be so much better quality but the fabric is flimsy(think old man white tanks that come in a pack) completely see through and lack of shape..i wanted to love this but definitely photographed significantly better than actuality!
0,"I like the design and the color of the cardigan (i got green). i like the details on the back. the cardigan is tts  the shoulder width and sleeves length seems perfect (for reference: 5'7""  125 lb  got size s).    the problem for me is that the cardigan is not as long as it looks in the photos for the rose color; the pictures for the beige show the length more accurately. it may work for a smaller lady  but i like my cardigans a bit longer and cozier.    also  it is not just that the material is"
0,I have been looking for a nice white top to go with many of my skirts for summer  and this is not it. like others  it's just so thin and sheer. i live in the south. i don't need my bra showing and i was wearing a nude bra when i tried this on and you can see everything. this is fine to layer in cooler temps  but now in our horrible summers where that's the last thing i wish to do.    - the only plus i can tell you is it's tts and the fabric is so comfortable and feels great on the skin. however 
-1,The colors in this dress are beautiful (the green/blue version) but the fabric is a very see through mesh and feels flimsy. i purchased it online and wasn't expecting it to be so sheer -- the particular empire cut combined with the fabric makes it feel more like a nightgown  i really wanted to love it but it's going back.
0,I really wanted this skirt to work but it didn't look very flattering on me. a great midi length and very cool pattern  so hopefully will work for others!
1,Another success! so comfortable and stylish for spring and summer. very lightweight yet not sheer. design is even more appealing in person. a must have for your closet.
-1,Purchased this in two colors online. purchased in an xs - i am usually a s or xs. the fit was really large in the xs and the seam on the front of the top was in the wrong place and was really unflattering. returning both.
0,Too pricey for the quality of this imported product.
0,"I ordered this skirt because the 4 i tried on in store was huge and the 2 was way too small. the sizing was an issue so i thought i would try another 4. the skirt that arrived by mail was so wrinkled it was obvious that a day of wear would turn it into a nightmare of unflattering creases and stretched out areas. i like the concept of the design with the button front and a-line ""princess"" seams in the front and back  but i just feel the fabric in this skirt has too much stretch. i returned it."
0,I love the pattern of this shirt but there is definitely a design flaw in the arm/armpits.
1,These are a comfortable  flattering casual pant. i usually wear a 27 in skinny jeans  so i dropped down to a 26 to make sure they weren't to baggy. i love them and will wear the a lot!
1,"Love this top! i've worn it once and received several compliments. i'm 5'7""  127  and the small fit well. i'm happy with my purchase."
-1,Color is not like photo and fit doesn't work if you're busty
1,I'm glad i listened to the other reviewers...i ordered a large instead of my usual medium. it's roomy enough for a sweater underneath. i love the denim! it's very soft and has some stretch. my other denim jackets are stiff even after years of washing. i also love the darker denim.
0,"Got them in the light blue. i'm 5'0"" so they're a little long. i like the texture and they are really comfortable! the only thing is the awkward seams around the crotch area so you really can't wear them alone with a cropped tee or shorter top."
1,I am not really a fan of jumpsuits/rompers/etc. but i love this jumpsuit. very good quality and design. fits well  but i thought the 4 was pretty large for a 4. i mean  i probably should have gotten a 2 (which was sold out)  but i don't usually have to get a 4 tailored. i did in this case  but it was still worth it.
-1,I ordered the black and white pattern  which was ok. i got a small  but the shirt was very square - with a short and wide fit! i doubt an xs would have helped with such a boxy shirt. sent this one back.
-1,I can't stand buying pants and i can see the pockets lining and my darker skin through the fabric. i don't consider that high-quality.
1,I ordered the cream. the fabric is unique. similar to a waffle but with a dressy quality. you definitely need a cami or tank underneath. its form fitting without being too snug. i like to wear it with distressed jeans  front tucked in and kind of ruched to hide my middle  (my trouble spot) with chunky accessories  belt  necklace and a block heel. it's a little pricey but decided worth it.
0,I really wanted to love this. i kept refreshing the page so that i could order it as soon as my size was in stock. i love the colors and struggle to find cute dresses in natural fabrics for the summer. unfortunately as another reviewer mentioned the cut of the arm holes is strange. it cut my off in the most unflattering spot.
0,I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is off slightly. i ordered my regular size xs and the chest/shoulder area fits nice but the waist comes very tight and not flattering to wear unless style similar to the model with a tucked in look. nice color and decent quality fabric but not my favorite fit. going back to the store.
0,I practically live in lounge pants  and i like the unique style of this wide-leg version. i'm generally a 6/28 in pants and ordered the small which fit well  if a bit big. the overall fit is great - slim at the hip with a nice wide waistband  and flatteringly-placed dropped pockets. the pants really slim my hips and provide a nice silhouette with the wide legs. the fabric is soft and flows and i did not experience any sheerness. as for color - i would call these a deep cool brown  definitely not
1,This is beautiful tunic for the spring and summer. great paired with jeans or white denim. runs large and is a true tunic length. very pretty fabric and built in camisole  too. only downside is that it probably needs to be hand washed/line dried to keep it looking like new.
1,This is the softest  most perfectly cut basic. love the black  wish the white was a true white or ivory instead of heathered. as usual with retailer basics  i prefer the regular length despite being petite with a short torso.
1,This is my second pair of pilcro chinos. their pants and shorts are so soft--even those who love to run around pantless might relent. this brand tends to run a bit large so if you like your pants form fitting you may want to size down.
-1,I grabbed this dress to try on in my usual size  because i needed to see what the hype was about this style of dress  and it left me puzzled.  the print was pretty  but no amount of tailoring could save it for me.  it was wearing me.  maybe it could wear three of me.  i feel like this is a way for clothing manufacturers to cut corners  by making a garment without details (no installing more time consuming zippers  buttons or snaps  and making something that fits a wide range of sizes because it
-1,I was so excited about this top  and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely  but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated  and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.
0,I'm 5'8 128lbs and bought a size 2. i loved this dress  but didn't expect to have to go bra-less or wear a tube top under. the top lands much lower than i expected but the rest of the dress was lovely.     i ordered a size 2
1,"This skirt is a beautiful fabric  heavy and soft  and fully lined. it has two sets of snaps on the inside so you can adjust the waist size. i purchased a medium  but found that there wasn't enough of an overlap in the split to be decent (it flaps open when i walk  revealing nearly everything!)  so i will be exchanging for a large. for reference  i typically wear a size 10 or 12 in pants and skirts. the color is true to the photos  with a matte finish. i am 5'8"" and length hit me below the knee."
1,This sweater is so soft and warm and i love it with the matching leggings. i say it is true to size  however i ordered it a size up so that it covers the bottom/crotch area when i am wearing the leggings. normally wear an xs  ordered a small and it works well. it is very well made. i absolutely love it!
-1,"I'm 5'4""  32c and 125 lbs. i ordered the size 4p and while the color and fabric is pretty  the back and front bodice were much to low to wear a bra even if i were to shorten the straps. it was also very tight across my ribs. despite ordering a petite  the hem was much too long. i ended up returning it."
