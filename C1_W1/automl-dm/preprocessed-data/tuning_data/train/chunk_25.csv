-1,"I truly cannot understand the great reviews on this dress!  i purchased in both a sp and a mp.  i am 5'2"" 120#.  the mp fit perfectly.  i definitely wouldn't keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together.  it's not super soft  coarse on the inside  and feels old.  the back is longer than the front  it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps.  even with leggings and great boots  it looks worn."
-1,I purchased this in the yellow xs. it is very comfortable  but extremely see-through. you'd have to wear a slip or something underneath it  but i'm not sure what would work based on the style  and even if i wore a strapless bra it was still see-through. unfortunately i had to return it.
0,I'm usually a 12  or size l in retailer and when i tried this on  buttoning it up from the bottom  i was so excited...until i reached the chest. it was way too tight in the bust and i am not that big in that area - it was painfully tight on my 38d chest. it's also unlined  which makes it not very useful for anything other than the warmest times of year. it's a shame because the skirt is swishy  and a good length - many trenches are too short  or not wide enough on the bottom for a fuller figure. i
0,I had high hopes for this top. really boxy  short
0,I got this top planning to wear it with the sleeves up rather than off the shoulder  like in one of the photos. my regular size (medium) was way too large so i went down to a small. however  the collar was still too wide for the sleeves to stay above my bra straps. back it goes. if you're looking for a strictly off-the-shoulder top  you might like it. color is deep blue and the cotton is a nice weight.
-1,Loved this dress online  but my small pettie stature made me looks like an orphan from the prairie.
1,As in most ribbed camis  this stretches out - so size down. it is very pretty/delicate (e.g. fabric is thin) and the silver/grey color has metalic thread running through. plan to pair it with an retailer grey bolero sweater for the holidays.
-1,This one didn't work for me. there is no zipper  you climb into it from the very large neck hole. it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug. the tie and waist seam didn't hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle. i tried other belts and it wasn't much better. the fabric and print were great. i love jumpers but this one went back.
1,"Although this is not my husband''s favorite (he prefers things a little more tailored). i absolutely adore this! i got this in the ivory/cream color not realizing they had it in two more colors. i just ordered the blue. i loved the way the size small fit (not as wide)  but the medium for my height (5'7"") fit better and was longer. if i want to wear it as a dress  i could. i highly recommend this!! well made and looks great!!!"
1,These jeans are great. the rise is perfect.
0,"The colors in the green shirt are beautiful  however the cut looked like a maternity top on me. i'm 5'6"" 120#  not very busty. must try it on to match the right body type; i'm thinking very tall  wispy   less curves..."
0,I really like the idea behind this top  but at least for me  the execution wasn't quite there. i was hoping it would be something i could wear to work  but the sheerness of the sides makes it in appropriate for my workplace (when it gaps/you move  you can see a lot). if you don't move  the front panel is pretty opaque  which is good. i think it would look odd with a cami underneath and i don't feel comfortable with the sheerness  so i returned it. i also thought the finish on the sleeves looked
1,I love the idea of this top. it's made really well. the only issue is its a bit shorter than i thought and the neckline rubs on my neck.
-1,I saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work. the cut was so strange. it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist. i even ordered up a size based on reviews. i ordered an 8 when i normally where a small (6) in things. the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else.

1,This skirt is great for anyone who wants to highlight a defined waistline  but may want to skim over a few lumps and bumps. the skirt has a nice  wide waistband that hugs tight at the middle and pleats that give a little flare without being too much.  the fabric is nice and thick and the skirt is lined.  i am looking forward to wearing it to the office with a fitted dark top and heels.
1,I saw this peasant blouse online and thought it looked cute  but not really enough to spend the money on. i purchased a few other things instead. i happened to go into the store to see a different top in person and spotted this one. it is definitely cuter in person. as with most tops like this  it is baggy and loose. however  probably due to the elastic at the bottom  this one doesn't look overly big and shapeless. just a pretty top that will be perfect for spring. for reference  i am 5'6 115  a
0,These pants are really beautiful. the material feels nice and i love the pull on style  however  they are much too long for me. i'm 5'3 and they literally hang to my ankles which is not at all flattering like the photos. i think if you are tall enough  these are a wonderful piece.
-1,I so wanted to like this dress i ordered it for summer graduation and weddings. i usually wear a 4/s and even the xs is was too pig. it drapes like a smock. the material is heavy. the only thing pretty about this dress is the pattern and color.    still looking for the perfect dress...
-1,This jumpsuit is so cute and it looked amazing on. i had to return it because of the poor design. it was extremely hard to put on and take off! there are so many buttons to do and undo which are not as easy as snaps! the fabric buttons definitely make a great look to the jumpsuit but there should be a zipper on the side for easy access  or use snaps instead of the loops for the fabric buttons. what a shame of a lovely and classy design on a good quality material  but not worth it if it's difficu
0,Ordered med petite. love the print & design but it runs really big more like a large and length of top is not flattering . returning
1,I like this dress. the floral pattern and little red beads. others may think it is baggy  however  i like this type of the style.
-1,This is a crop top but super boxy and wide. i expected it to be more fitted in the waist. since it sits out away a from the body a lot  it was not flattering. i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me. too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and i'm willing to pay full price for something that works.
0,I agree with some of the other reviewers; this dress runs very large. when i tried on the xs in my local store  i loved the color and thought i could work with it with the right bra or camisole  but it was just cut far too low in the front and when i tried it on at home  it was just too roomy and not fitted enough. i ordered both an xsp and an xxs today so we will see if they fit better. it is an adoreable design  cut and color. it just runs way big so size down if you decide to get it.
0,The pink version of this top finally arrived -- nearly 2 months after ordering.  the expected delivery date kept slipping.  the color is not as shown online.  online it looks like a light pink.  the actual top was more of taupe color.  it's a basic tee with pretty ruffling at the bottom.  not enough to keep.
-1,When i tried it on  it was a bit shapeless  but it was on a promo so i decided to get it. i kind off like shapeless. i've worn it three times and washed it gently in the machine as recommended (in a lingerie bag  always) and air dried it. it now has a huge rip on the sleeve seam  and i cannot see how this happened. the inner lining is soft and substantial  but the outer gauze layer is thin.
-1,I loved this skirt on the rack. but it was not lined and super scratchy when worn. i could barely wear it for the length it took to try it on. so sad. such a gorgeous skirt.
1,The tie jacket is an easy one to throw on for a casual look. it fits well to the body even better than pictured. very comfortable and medium weight so perfect for spring.
-1,I would not recommend these pants if you have a curvy or athletic figure. these pants seem to be cut straight up and down. the fabric is not soft  the color is slightly more muted in person  and they are not as relaxed as they appear to be on the model.
-1,Looks great  the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area. total disappointment! i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side!
1,I was hesitant based on the reviews  but i'm glad i ordered this dress (in blue). the material is like a french dot texture that is soft but still a bit structured. i had no issues with the fit. it's appropriately just a little oversized. the styling is very mod!
1,This shirt is a very cute dressed up casual kind of top. the lace detail in the front and the back make a plain  long sleeve black top look elegant. the material on the shirt is pretty light  so it is for fall or spring.
1,This top is super flattering and comfortable. perfect summer wear!
0,This top is for someone flat chested and skinny. i really like the styling  color  fabric and everything except that it's not for my body type. i am a 36dd and have a little bit of a stomach... so it makes me look fat from the sides.  the pictures taken on the model are from the front and back - but i will bet she would still look good in it from the sides! will be returning it.
-1,If you are over 25  this top probably is not for you. it is absolutely see-thru. great style and beautiful light fabric  but you can see right thru it.
1,Love this tank. it is so soft and comfortable. the length hits just right on the hip. it hugs the body nicely  not too tight  just loose enough on a hot summer day. i have this in black and white. i wish they would offer more colors.
-1,"I'm 140 at 5' 8"". pear shape. the pockets really opened up when i put them on and didn't lay flat. loose on leg opening - which i liked. but the pockets sticking out around the hip area made my pear shape even wider. i got a medium"
1,This dress intrigued me a bit online  but not enough to order it to try it. even on the rack  i wasn't so sure about it  but decided to try it this afternoon. i couldn't have been more pleased. it is fresh  flattering  flowy  light and beautiful. even though there is quite a bit of fabric  the vertical stripes and nipped in waist make it extremely flattering. i didn't realize this came in blue as well. i may add that one to my wishlist  but the red one is a definite winner. it will make a great
1,"The first time i saw this in the store i passed it by because the fabric didn't appeal to me .... but the second time i tried it on and fell in love .... had to have it in the beautiful blue.  i'm busty 32h but wear a small and the gathers do wonders to camouflage  which was a nice surprise  because i usually avoid anything with fullness.  will look great with white or black jeans but i will also pair with a very subtle pattern legging as the length is perfect.  i'm short  5'3"".  neckline is fem"
0,The fabric is beautiful  even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large  as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure  even though it's a lapel  and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs  and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad  as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time.
0,I tried the yellow striped dress on in the store and it is completely sheer.
0,"I love these shorts  very pretty and well made  but if you have any kind of muscle in your thighs  beware  not as flattering as on the model a9dn probably previous reviewer). shorts hit at hte widest part of my leg  creating a weird tent effect around the area. waist was true to sizw and i can only imagine how beautiful they would be on ""skinny"" legs."
1,This yellow/mango color is so beautiful in person. i actually don't have the best skin tone for shades of yellow  but i couldn't resist trying this one on & it turned out to be perfect! the silhouette is very feminine  especially around the neckline & shoulders. there is a lot of fabric  but i actually appreciate that the dress is substantive. finally  the nicest thing is that the dress can easily be dressed up or dressed down depending on how you accessorize it. looking forward to summer!
-1,"I got this sweater with high hopes to wear it with some leggings for christmas. it looked adorable (and long!) on the model. however  it doesn't even cover my butt  that's how short it is. if you're anything over 5'4""  i'd say it'll be too short for leggings."
0,I loved the material's texture and drape  but it was too sheer for me. i am 100% against having to wear a tank under white tees. (which means i have a lot of trouble finding any white tees  but...)     other than the see-through nature  i loved this shirt!
0,I am curvy and this top  while stylish and i love the pockets  just didn't do it for me. it made my shoulders look wider than they are  which is a big no no. it would probably look better on someone with smaller shoulders or slimmer. the wool was also a tad itchy - not too itchy  just a bit. in general i don't wear wool without cashmere  i also don't wear non-italian wool because it is a bit rough and my skin reacts to it. so i stick to wool cashmere blend or loro piana soft wool. this sweater s
-1,Ordered this top online  as i loved the colors and design  but i should have listened to the other reviewers. i ordered my usual size m  and it was just very unflattering. it was short and wide  not at all like it's pictured on the model. needless to say it was immediately shipped back.
0,"This is a cute dress  but just not a keeper for me. the top portion of the dress is fairly snug. i am normally a small in retailer sizes  but i would have sized up the keep the dress from pulling so much across the bust. otherwise  it was cute and simple  and the tulle was quite soft.  i think that i would have gone with a medium  but i am wearing a small in the photo. for reference  i am 5'5""  ~135 lbs  34c  and 27"" waist."
0,I have been a big fan of this canadian designer so when i saw the sweater on the web  i immediately ordered it. on the website  it looks very modern and edgy chic. i was heartbroken when i saw it in person. when i opened the bag and put on the sweater  i noticed a lot of little black marks on the bathroom floor. it came from the sweater. size small was swimming on me and the holes on the shoulders  which supposed to look modern...well  the thin cheap material the sweater looks like it's ripped.
0,Definitely pj quality. i have a fairly thin frame and this hung on me like a tent. and it's very thin  so it works as a swim cover  but definitely not a dress for anything else.
0,This top fit me great across the bust - true to size there  however  it was very loose other than that (outside of the peplum of course). it did not seem flattering for my body shape/did not give me much shape on top. i was wider than i should be/am. this may work on some body types  but did not work for me. it was a nice feeling  comfortable top however.
-1,"I have these shirts in the blue and green and they were great. i'm 5'4"" c chest and athletic build - the small shirts fit pretty good and i love the fabric so i kept them. i really wanted these dresses to work but the cut was different even between the gray and burgundy. there was tons of room in the chest  but it was tight in the shoulders. i really wanted to love this  but there's just too many cut issues. it is a good length for work though."
-1,Pants are overpriced and very uncomfortable. to my utter dismay i wore them during a business trip for the first time and ended up with bruises caused by the side zipper. i have been a long time retailer shopper and usually my go to store  however ending up with a pair of pants that caused me pain was a very big disappointment 
-1,I am a pretty curvy girl and thought the m/l was gigantic. i returned and was afraid to exchange for the smaller size thinking it would pbly be very large as well. it was not flattering because it was so boxy.
1,"This sweater dress is beautifully unique in that it has lovely sheer sleeves to dress it up  but it's made of a soft sweater material that feels comfortable  warm and wintry at the same time. it does run true to size  i ordered a small (5'5"" and 118 lbs). knitted and knotted has come up with some killer sweater dresses this season!!!"
1,These have a great fit & design. i ordered a size larger after reading that this style runs on the small size. typically i'm a 27 but ordered a 28. the wash has a great vintage feel about it! i also love that these do not lose their shape after wearing all day.
0,This sweater in the neutral beige coloration was exactly what i wanted to rotate through my winter legging/boot rotation with different vests  belts  and scarves...spot on. it is not heavy weight  soft  perfect length for a tunic on a 5'4 frame  34c  125 lb....now the weird part - sleeves were excessively long and seem to have stretched longer after wear??? anyway  hand wash and little to no pilling a plus. i literally roll up the sleeves to wear this tunic and it tends to be bothersome  hence t
1,I love the color of this top. it is a dark olive green and elegant. i mostly wear it under a blazer with my jeans. it fits true to size and the smocking detail is casual and elegant at the same time.
-1,I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined  i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined  you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and  comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.
0,I really like the look of these socks  and have become obsessed we over-the-knee socks for winter this year. they are very tick which is nice for keeping warm and for durability for a long lasting product. my only complaint is that they are very difficult to get over the knee. this can be a great thing  because they certainly do stay put-which is a huge problem with over-the-knee socks. however  by the end of the day i was pretty sure i was going to lose a leg from poor circulation.  i am still
1,I love this dress! i was actually able to fit in a l versus my usual xl due to the style of the dress. a bigger chest person (i'm a d) may not find the dress as well fitting as i do. overall great fit can easily dress it warm with a scarf  boots  hat or best. a great dress for fall-spring
0,The fabric is very thin. it isn't see through  just thin. i would have kept this if the full length shell wasn't longer than the dress.
-1,It's like a work of art  but sadly  not flattering on me. i absolutely loved the look  and even considered taking it to a tailor  but the material overall is very stiff. if you're teeny tiny and need something to give you the illusion of hips  you might love it. very sad to return this.
-1,Long-time ag jeans fan. lately though  i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans  i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the steve capris i ordered (same review there).  so back both pairs went.   it's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material.
-1,Runs small. arms very short and hits in the wrong place across your chest. would not recommend.
1,The perfect simple black top. great fit - can be dressed up or down. closet staple!
1,I read the other reviews and from the picture it looked as though it may be a little short  so i ordered up to a large. the medium would have fit  but since i'm in my mid-40's i felt more comfortable with large. but if you are trim and young or young at heart your usual medium will be fine. live the material and the navy makes it classy and rich looking. can be dressed up or down. have worn it to a cocktail party fundraiser with blue crop pants and received many compliments. i'm always challenge
1,I agree with other reviewers that this top runs large - i'm glad i ordered a size down. it's a cute twist on a basic tee shirt.
-1,The buttons on the back are very tedious. you will need someone to help you. if you get past that hurdle  then you have the look of a little girl in a smock. way too big. like a nightgown. nice quality  but not practical.
1,Purchased these in both colors today. (great sale price.)  hei hei is my favorite brand of pants  especially their pull on prints.  i am always a medium  these ran slightly large in the waist and stomach. i tried on a few mediums and luckily found the smallest in each.  the beige motif is beautiful and can really be dressed up. the material is soft the color scheme is gorgeous. they have a lovely silky feel to them. i always wear an over top so the little bit largeness won't bother me. being on
