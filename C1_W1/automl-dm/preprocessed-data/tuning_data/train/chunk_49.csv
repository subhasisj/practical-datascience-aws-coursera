0,"I love holding horses and i am always be size 2 in their clothes (32dd  5'3""  curvy). i ran into my local retailer to grab a shirt they had on hold and had to try this on because it's so cute. i couldn't get the 2 zipped and it seemed to be rather narrow in the torso. such a bummer!"
0,I fell in love with this dress when the catalog came in the mail and jumped online immediately to order it. the dress just arrived and is not as pictured in the catalog - the picture of the model walking on the beach. in that picture it appears to have black lining or a black slip underneath when in reality there is nude lining sewn into every edge and isn't going anywhere - for a minute i thought about having it removed by a tailor but it seems the entire dress would have to be re-sewn. some of
1,"I love drop shoulder sweaters and find them to be very flattering so i took a chance on this one despite the reviews stating it runs very large. i was attracted to the style as well as the natural cotton fiber  which i find holds up best over time. i am 34b and usually wear xs or small and in this i ordered the xs. it fits perfectly! i layered this soft pink sweater over a rounded hem tee with a black and white pattern; so cute! it is slightly short on my 5'8"" frame so the shirt tail hems peeked"
1,"I bought this blouse at the store today and i love it! they stylist brought it for me to try on with the green chinos and it was perfect. it will go with jeans or dark pants as well. very unique and flattering! i got a size 2. i'm 5'7'"" and 130 pounds."
0,I wanted to love this jacket. so soft and great color. unfortunately it is just too light weight. it is almost like shirt fabric. nice heft to the fabric though. nice length - accept the sleeves were short on me. i am 5'10 and 135lbs. the small was the right size. i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer.
-1,"This is a beautiful spring/summer dress  and the quality of the materials is great. i wanted to love it. but the sizing is ridiculous! i'm 5'3"" and 115 and i think you could fit three of me comfortably in the xs. while the pictures of the model in the dress don't suggest it has a shapeless cut  it definitely looked like a sack on me. a sack with a lovely print  but still an ill-fitting sack."
1,I have these tops in white and blue. very comfotable to wear. the back part swings with movements and is flattering. good price so i got one for my daughter!
1,These pants are great. the pattern is beautiful and the fit is perfect. they pair well with a s front tucked shirt or fitted colwyn neck sweater. another great find from retailer!
1,"This is such an easy dress to wear and it looks very polished! it is not a ""cheap polyester"" fabric as one reviewer wrote. it is a rayon and nylon blend. it does wrinkle easily. i love that the belt is actually sewn into the dress at the back. i don't typically gravitate toward warm color palette  but the burnt orange color is really lovely. it can be dressed up or down very easily. and it has pockets! i typically wear xs in retailer brands  and the size 0 fit me well."
-1,This dress has been in my inbox for a long time and when it went on sale i purchased it right away. i am a size 4 petite in everything retailer and have not had a problem with fit  if anything i might have to size down. i purchased a 4 petite in this dress and i couldn't zip it all the way up. it was as if i was trying to get into a 0 petite.  i don't even think a size 6 would fit. there is something not right with the make of this particular dress i received. even if the fit was perfect i didn't
0,"Got this for my daughter for christmas. she loves the ""boho peasant"" look. i thought the fabric would be white or at least cream color but it was closer to pale yellow. although the fabric quality and texture is lovely (more substantive than i expected)   she just couldn't like the top with the color being so off. disappointing as picture makes it much prettier."
-1,I was so looking forward to wearing these pants on an upcoming trip. i already had my outfits planned! when these pants arrived  however  they were very different from those shown in the pictures online. firstly  the pants are  in actuality  quite cropped. i am 5'9-- the model in the pictures is at least that height  if not taller-- and the hems were several inches above my ankles. secondly  the pants appear to be an even wider cut than what's shown  although the width of the pant legs may have
1,"One of the more beautiful pieces retailer hags carried in a long time. i instantly fell in love the second i took it out of the box. the only problem is that it runs short in the torso. i ordered the xs and it fit perfectly everywhere except it gave me a wedgie. for reference  i am 5'6"" 120 lbs  and a 34b. i returned the jumpsuit and ordered it in a small. hopefully it's long enough!!! everything about it is true to size except torso length. i have an average torso  so someone with a large torso m"
0,Cute details but not happy with the fit. runs wide and short. the peplum fabric on bottom is stiff  wrinkles easily  and lays funny. returning this one.
-1,Was excited to receive this dress as i got it at a great price on sale. the colors are great and it fits pretty good  but it came without a slip!!  so disappointing to not receive the entire dress!!  hence the 2 stars. may send it back for this reason.
0,"Beautiful sweater dress. nice texture gorgeous pattern. however not for my body type! i'm 5'5""  a size 12-14 and i carry my weight in hips butt & tummy area. this dress is only slightly a line  almost straight and even the xl didn't look flattering on me. and the arms are definitely smaller and weird too-there is bunching in the pit area. i tried on a large for comparison and it was too tight all over and there was a button missing too. this def. runs small and i think will be flattering on the"
1,I got this dress to wear for christmas and it is perfect. looks great and is very comfy. low cut in front and back that is not too revealing and allows for perfect bra coverages. i got it in a small small.
-1,....that's what i look like wearing this dress. a sad  sad  sack. the fabric is less than ideal  and there is no shape to speak of. i love that it has pockets but that's about it. there was just way too much fabric for a petite person. this dress has got to be good on someone  sadly that person was not me.
-1,I usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand. they are lightweight  sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body. this brand can run big  so i usually buy a size 2 rather than my normal size 4. i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first  but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes: 26 and 27 because they didn't label them 2  4  6 etc. anymore. these pants still look well made and have cute little details  but they are bigger than ever!! the 27's
-1,"I can't believe the reviews this dress has gotten. i ordered it and was so excited to get it. when i tried it on all of my excitement was gone. while i love the color the quality just isn't there and its not worth the money even with the 25% discount i used. the fabric is not thick  in fact it is quite sheer for ""velvet"". i honestly wouldn't feel comfortable with out a slip on underneath this. second is the fit. i'm 5'6 32a  xs on top 4 on bottom and i ordered an xs and the way this hung on me w"
0,Very very cute. bought in store yesterday. put it on today to wear and it is huge. i normally buy a large in tshirts. i will return for either a small or medium but will try on in the store. oh well.
0,I definitely like unique things  but the sleeves are way too much on this sweater.  it's a shame because it is so soft and comfortable  but overall i felt it looked somewhat silly on me.
0,"This jumpsuit is lovely and comfortable  with gorgeous embroidered detailing  but it really needs to come in petite sizes. at 5'4"" with a pretty proportional torso to leg ratio  i found the hem length okay but the top portion way too long. for the waistband to be anywhere near my natural waist  the shoulders would have had to be taken up several inches and the armholes shortened."
1,This skirt makes me look at least a size smaller. i love it! the sa was wearing it in the store and it liked great on her as well with just a plain white top. tts- got my usual 10 in green.
0,I wish that it had fit me better as the feel of the fabric and the color were great! regrettably  i am sending it back as the v opening is too low for my tastes and the fabric on the left of the first layer drapes weird on me. i am usually a s or m and in this top the s was plenty of length and room  would be swimming in a m. the fabric was soft and felt great against your skin and not thin as some fabrics can be. the color was just as shown and beautiful. hope it works for some of you out there
0,This top was really cute on someone else  but not on me... on me  ti was too big and the color washed me out. the fabric is nice and the pattern and colors are nice too  just not on porcelain skin... like many tops this season  it is a bit boxy  but looks nice with jeans  white shorts or half-tucked into a skirt. i would probably size down a bot...
0,"The minute i put this on i knew it was wrong. firstly  the neck was quite tight and i had to untie the side tie. secondly  as i stood looking in the mirror  the dress simply read ""nightgown"". it was frumpy and too long on me. so back it went."
0,I was excited to receive this top because i love the design  but was very disappointed when it arrived. i thought the embroidery would be striking but it's not. the material is a t-shirt knit which also added to the disappointment. it was not flattering at all.
-1,I ordered a med petite. usually this fits but this shirt was long and the sleeves wouldnt stay down. as a regular shirt it was not cute.
1,The fold over is so comfy. not the most flattering but really when you are wearing it you are going for comfort i think. bought these on sale and trying to decide if they are worth it or not
1,Love this suit. i ordered up a size on the bottoms  and am so glad i did. the style fits true to size  is beautiful  and vibrant. i thought it looked like ribbing vertically  but it is just part of the design. it is not padded at all  but is thick enough to be seamless.
0,I ordered this top online in two colors  and kept the berry color. i liked it while trying it on. when i wore it an entire day  the top just didn't look that good. it wasn't flattering  and it focused on the bad areas despite being loose fitting. it didn't seem very flattering. i wore it for one day and am not happy with my purchase. i wish i could send it back but i already wore it. the fit just isn't very flattering. it is loose but focuses on the curves not in a good way if you are curvy.
-1,I wanted to like this coat so bad! i loved the bright red color and design  but when i received it  it seemed very cheap and just too large. i returned it.
0,I liked that this was a unique take on a sweatshirt. pretty seam down the back and weight of material. i'm going to return it because i wish it was a little more of a loose/baggy fit and under-pattern is darker than i thought.
1,When i received this dress i was surprised by the weight of the fabric. it's not as light and gauzy as the photos appear  and it is fully lined. it's more substantial in a good way. also i had thought it would be more of a straight cut but it's definitely a swing which i prefer. with the lining  it does stand out a bit from your body so it's not a clingy look at all. i like it a lot but i don't think it fits the way you would expect from the photo. it's roomy  i could probably have sized down. i
-1,I purchased the blue with white dots. the shape was awful  but looked like a sack - returned
-1,I was surprised retailer decided to ship this sweater. the sweater looks like it's falling apart and it is huge. i would not recommend this even at a clearance price.
1,I have thicker thighs and don't usually find that i can wear this kind of thing. these  on the other hand  are hot  hot  hot and are even somehow slimming for my thighs. i just adore them. i'm waiting for the green color to go on sale so i can buy them too!
0,"The skirt is very pretty  but it's not as dark as the street pictures which i like those colors better. it's also super long. it will have to be hemmed if i decide to keep it. for reference  i'm 5'7"" and it was sweeping the floor (size medium). given the price  i'm not certain i will keep it. i'll try it on a few times  then decide."
0,Unfortunately i didnt read the fine print when i ordered this re: dry cleaning only  but this in itself wasnt a total deal breaker. it did fit well -- i am 5'2  32c  107 lb and the xs petite fit very well  definitely form-fitting  not long in the arms or waist. the grey heather design was not my favorite look  actually thats the main reason i am returning it -- there was a dark grey splotch of the heathered design on the chest  and it looked like i had a huge dark stain.
0,"The style of this dress is quite lovely  i immediately gravitated towards it when i saw in the store  however once i tried it on it looked like a sack of potatoes...unfortunately the loose silhouette did not do anything for my figure  i should mention that i am 5'9"" and have an athletic figure but with hips.   the design is very on trend and the dress does have some lovely details like the lace around the hip area and flowy fabric. but unfortunately it was not enough for me to purchase. also the"
1,These are called jeans but they aren't exactly jean material. they are black with a nice stretch to the fabric. a bit tighter on the thighs than the flare jeans but the stretch to the fabric makes it work. i like these very much  a very slimming effect. mid rise- which looks very chic.highly recommend!
-1,Looks like a pregnancy top. a lot gathers in front and back. added 10 pounds to me. not flattering on  much longer than on the model. and the color is not white. it's white with a weird tan/ taupe stripe.  i returned it same day i received it  which was disappointing.
-1,The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit  sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however  that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy   stiff  and  frankly  uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining  and that might have solved the problem of scratchy  itchy fabric.  the stiff fabric of the bo
-1,I bought these a great alternative to black jeans but they are headed back.  the texture is nice but let's call them what they are- thin  leggings.  not worth the price in my opinion.  honestly  i can't seem to find a pair of pilcros that i like so i'd spent the extra money on a better pair of black jeans.
-1,It is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph. it made my 5 foot frame look short and wide.
-1,I'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress. the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange. for one thing  the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse. i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag. also  the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss
1,This is a gorgeous buttondown. the colors are stunning - i love the mix of blue and brown. the fabric is super soft and drapes just right. i feel the this shirt runs true to size. i'm an xxs petite and it fit perfect. this one is a winner!
0,"Really wanted this to worked for me. ordered the s in ivory (the color i really wanted but xs was sold out) and the xs in cedar.  loved the knit and look and quality but the sweater was boxy and huge even in xs.  not flattering on my petite frame (5'2""  115#).  so disappointed as i've been looking for a non-wool sweater like this."
-1,"The quality of the garment is high--a nice substantial yarn and a pretty crochet pattern  but the cut was totally off for me. i'm usually an xs/s  and was swimming in the xs. the arms in particular were huge and drapey  and the whole thing just hung on me (for reference  i'm 5'4""  120 lbs)."
1,I really like this sweater. i would suggest ordering a size up. i could had worn my normal size but a size up was much more comfortable. i have a burnt orange skirt that i wear with this and it makes the flowers pop.
1,Soft knit  perfectly finished  comfortable and looks great on the model and the previous reviewers' mom.  it just looks too 'empty-nester' for my style (and i won't be until 2035!)  this is a nice base for a creative dresser/accessorizer  which i'm not.  i'm also messy so it's hard to keep ivory clothing coffee free.  i'm glad i tried it on because it proves how great a label knitted & knotted is for quality garments.  just had to pass on this for personal style reasons.
-1,These run very small!! they are also short  almost like a crop pant. the fit was so weird that i won't even exchange for a bigger size.
1,Really cute top  comfy  with just enough flare that it can be dressed up a bit  or worn just casual. not clingy at all...in fact  maybe just a tad too flowy around the middle  but not so much that it kept me from going back to buy it immediately in a second color! i typically wear a large  but suspect the arms on the medium might be a tad small if i sized down.
-1,I'm very disappointed in the quality. it seems more like a pajama than a tunic. definitely not worth 100.00 dollars. i plan to return it.
1,This cardigan is utterly gorgeous. way prettier on than i feared. my only issue is it felt a little itchy in the arms  and so i finally looked closely at the tag. the tag says the *back* section (which looks exactly like the weave on the arms) has a measly 5% wool snuck into the fabric content. why  retailer? why wool? i am so sensitive to it! my eyes have been demon red and itchy all day  classic symptoms that led to my getting rid of anything in my wardrobe with wool in it.  now i have a problem
-1,Quality piece except the fit is way off. i have a 32 c bust and long narrow torso  larger on the bottom. i ordered the small. i frequently wear a small/extra small on top and i was busting out of this in the chest area. however  the fit then flares way out from the torso and it just looked dumpy and overpowered my 6 foot frame. i marked it as running small  which it does on top  but then it runs very large on bottom. wanted it to work  but didn't.
0,I ordered this in hopes of wearing as a tunic with leggings for my rehearsal dinner. it is much shorter than expected and wouldn't have looked right with leggings. it also was more gray than ivory and in the short time i had it on was shedding lint like crazy. beautiful in photos but didn't work for me.
1,Cute  comfortable  easy to wear  even on my hourglass figure. can't decide the best shoes to wear with this - so it doesn't look frumpy.
0,This style is very pretty and flattering. i love the flow of the material and the open shoulders are nice for the design
1,"The is a cute dress with a great pattern and nice material. it would look great on the right kind of figure. i'm 5'7"" and slim  but at thirteen weeks pregnant and not showing  the skirt made me look about thirty weeks pregnant  but the top fit just fine."
-1,Before i ordered this i noted the other reviews that said it was sheer but thought i would just wear a layer underneath. unfortunately it was one of the sheerest fabrics i've ever seen. would love it if it could have been a more substantial fabric. to me it wasn't worth the money even on sale.
-1,Noticed all the 5 star reviews online for the latest pilcro stets- so due to the past 2 years of dissapointment of what was once a great pair of jeans....i was hopeful that retailerpologist listened and went back to the original pilcro stet formula- thick denim  just the right amount of give and a flattering 10 inch rise. walked right in and found them- and i knew right when i touched them- they were still the thin denim that's nowhere near the quality they once were. consumers pay attention and t
-1,The turqoise color is pretty  however  it did smell bad out of the package. i wore it once and it transferred the dye to my skin and white pants  bra and cami! hope it all comes out in the wash. i tried to hand wash the shirt and now have blue hands and a blue tub.
0,This is a very cute designed shirt but it fits very boxy and runs large
1,This dress is a great casual outfit. tha fabric is substantial and very soft. the only negative would be it is a little large through the chest/arms. i ordered a large as i am curvy but would like to exchange for a medium. sadly the medium is sold out but i love the dress so much i am keeping it!
1,This dress is so pretty- the colors are vibrant  beautiful pattern  the ruched part in the center hides the tummy!!! the neck line was too low for me  so had to wear a red cami underneath which hid the skin showing parts in the back around the waist. so instead of skin color  it was now red- even more prettier! no body could tell!! got so many compliments!!!
1,I love  love these wide leg pants! the embroidery detail give them a little something extra special. they are comfortable  and perfect. the length is great for wedges  and the fold over waist does not add bulk. the only downside  and this is probably due to my figure  but the pockets do need to be sewn shut so that they will lie flat.
0,Not sure what to think! i had great plans for this dress
1,"Bought pink and cream colors on sale. arm holes on my usual size medium were large so bought smalls and like them a lot. i'm 5'9"" and longer front and back worked well. fabric weave nice weight and good for summer or cooler with sweater or jacket over it."
0,Just received two  the red and the black. the black is a great print  very versatile. both run large  but the black most significantly so. the red is close enough to fitting to keep. the black shows my bra b/c it is so large and the armholes cut far too deeply. (the red also shows a fair amount of the armpit area  but (barely) covers my bra.    the material is somewhat thinner than expected  but not so sheer that a skin-toned bra wouldn't be sufficient.
